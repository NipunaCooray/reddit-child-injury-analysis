      "My now husband has been involved and active in childs life since the age of 6 months. He is now almost 4. Me and my husband have a 15 month old and another on the way. In the beginning, we obviously referred to my husband as his name to my son. He called him by his name or attempted to anyway when he was first learning to talk, eventually though he started calling him dada and daddy totally on his own, not sure if he picked up on it from what he would see on tv or in public people would refer to my husband as his daddy as they obviously didnt know the situation. We did try correcting it at first for a while but he never stopped. Then once we fell pregnant and had our baby, we were always referring to my husband as daddy totally our new baby of course. So my son has always seen my husband as daddy. His birth father is somewhat involved he sees him twice a month but thats a whole separate issue on its own… We always refer to his birth father as his daddy also and have always encouraged a positive relationship with him even when things are rough. We just say he has two daddys. His birth father gets angry with our son when he calls his step dad daddy but thats really all he knows. Is there a problem with this? \n",
      "edit** i just want to also add that for about a year after our son was born his birth father was essentially totally absent in his life. So my husband was the only father figure he saw and had present. im sure this adds to it.\n",

She has a small bruise on her forehead. I was able to soothe her after a bit and she calmed down. Should I take her to the er? I think she’s okay, but I just feel so guilty. I’m so tired. I’ve been working full time while my fiancé has been away at school for a month and our baby tuned 4 months on the 8th. She was so happy right before this happened and I feel sooo bad.  \n",

      "So today started out good, my kids had their first day of school and they had a great day. And then while I was cooking dinner they decided to go play outside with the neighbors kids, and the neighbor was watching them. But then I just hear a kid start crying and screaming \"mom\" and it sounded like my 6 year old daughter and so I run outside and it was her, and she was on the ground because what happened was she was riding her scooter and her glasses started falling off her face so she tries to grab them and looses control of the scooter and she fell off and slid on the concrete. So I take her inside and her arm and shoulder are bleeding a lot and it was big I literally had to have my oldest run to the store to get big bandaids and she couldn't find any big enough to so we just had to wraph gauze on it with medical wrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "And eventually she stopped crying, and I was able to get her in the bath and to bed but I felt so guilty like I do whenever my kids get hurt. Because I'm always thinking if there was a way I could've stopped it. LIke what if I had made her put on her strap for her glasses like I do when she goes to dance so they wouldn't have slipped so she didn't try and grab them? Or what if I had been there beside her and caught her before she fell? Stuff like that. And thank God she was wearing her helmet. And I've always been like that, and I feel so guilty like it was my fault. I remember once my oldest sprained her wrist at cheer and I felt awful. And when my 11 year old daughter was born she was a NICU baby and the whole entire time I felt awful like I or my body had failed her somehow, still to this day I'll feel guilty about that even thought she's fine now.\n",

I walked away for a minute to use the bathroom, and heard him screaming a scream I have never heard a baby make before. I ran so fast, my heart shattered. My baby was face first on the hard floor from about a two ft fall. I soothed him as I called his pediatrician. They told me to bring him in to be seen. He has a red mark above his eye, but no significant bump. No matter what, I am shattered. I feel so negligent and stupid. My mom has been helping me, as I am a single mom 28(f), and she just left for vacation for two weeks. Of course this would happen when she is gone. Even though they said baby boy looks fine and will be okay, I can’t help but worry. Will he develop some kind of lifelong issues from this? Will this harm his development? He was a premier baby, now 15lbs, born 6 weeks early. How could I do this to my child? I know it happens, but he is my heart out of my chest and I left him vulnerable. Never again. \n",

      "Yesterday my partner got a concussion at work, so he’s on strict 48-hour watch. We got home and he basically slept the whole time. At around 10 PM right after I got the baby down for the night he asked me what was for dinner. I had started it earlier in the day but decided I didn’t care to eat it then, so I put it in the fridge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I knew he needed to eat, so I went downstairs, finished dinner, and sat down with him. Before I could even finish my own plate, he fell asleep on me. I was trapped on the couch until 1 AM before I could wake him up and send him to bed and then I still had to clean up and put dinner away a second time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen minutes after I got upstairs, the baby woke up. I hadn’t even brushed my teeth or gotten ready for bed, I just wanted to crash maximize sleep time. But he’s teething right now, so it took until 2:45 AM to get him down again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it’s 7:00 I've been up for a few hours, had maybe 3 hours of sleep, and baby is ready for the day. No nap for me either like I normally get on weekends, because the doctor said my partner can’t be alone with the baby or handle anything important this weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right now, I’m so overstimulated from exhaustion that I’m struggling to even feed my baby without crying. As in I'm actively crying. I can’t have caffeine for health reasons, so there’s no quick fix. Somehow I still have to get through the weekend taking care of my partner who can barely function, my 7-month-old with a cutting tooth, and both dogs… while also magically keeping myself alive?!\n",

If there's a 4th nap, there's usually also. 2-2.5hr WW before that. If I try to put him to sleep before or do a set schedule he'll just scream until I stop putting him to sleep.

I would wake up in a panic almost nightly thinking I had fallen asleep nursing her, she was suffocating in the mattress, fell off the bed, or wrapped in the sheets. I would frantically search the bed. She was sound asleep in her bassinet. We moved her to her own room around 3 months because of this and I slept better. 7/8 months hit and now not only me but my husband will wake up in a panic about random things. One night he woke up thinking she had gotten a hold of a battery (we have a toy that lost its battery cover and we had just realized it that day.) A few nights ago I woke up thinking she was in our bed but crawled off it (she never sleeps with us.) Last night, my husband woke up CONVINCED she was right beside me “yes she’s right there!!” until I woke him up and he said “oh.” Also he thought she was crawling around on the ground. \n",

She only nods or shakes her head. We can tell she’s still asleep, and I highly doubt she fell out of bed because she sleeps in a daybed usually all the way against the head board.

      "\n",
      "My beautiful, sweet, ULTRA-social 14 month old daughter has recently been invited to a play group of kids of mixed ages from infant to school-aged. We went for the first time tonight and my toddler had a blast interacting with other kids, however, she walks very quickly, gets into everything, and has no concept of personal space nor is aware of her own strength-all perfectly normal toddler things. Here comes in my question; I started out hovering behind her as she moved around the room so I could intercept unsolicited touches or hits on unsuspecting kids, but when I did, the parents of said kids said she was totally fine, so I backed off a bit, but watching her interact with the other kids and parents made me wonder if it was REALLY fine and when I should step in to a situation. I feel like if I hover despite everyone being okay with her touching and possible hitting, I may be talked about as a helicopter mom. On the other hand, if I don't do enough to try and redirect her, I'm worried I'll be considered neglectful or just a bad mom. I have a really hard time reading certain social cues and I'm not really sure what they mean by \"it's completely fine\" and if it's ACTUALLY completely fine! \n",

The flight attendant told us to move, and my husband took our son to sleep around 8 seats in front, I stayed back, and fixed a bottle of warm milk which always soothes our son in case of some crying.  The people in the seat in front (young guys) complained. I explained our seats were not functioning properly.\n",

They have two infants across the aisle from them also in a bulkhead, I think mostly quiet.

My mom was also interviewed without a translator present (case worker didn’t speak Spanish and my mom’s English is middling at best) and instead had someone who was shadowing her attempt to translate (he didn’t speak Spanish, either). My therapist let me know that this is highly unethical and advised me to speak to the case supervisor as I should have been asked for consent to have the shadow present (was not asked) and that a third-party translation service should have been provided to my mother for any kind of interview. I’m debating whether I should make the call or not because on the one hand, I just want to put this entire ugly situation behind me but on the other, that kind of abuse of position shouldn’t go unchecked.

Today she screamed & cried all the way home so aggressively our 3 year old started to cry also. I’m at a loss for what to do she knows a decent amount of words but there’s really no getting her to talk when she’s having a tantrum. How can we go about discipling her for screaming where she’d understand & lower her voice? I understand tantrums are normal at this age i just want her to not scream she is literally breaking the sound barrier with how loudly she screams & shrieks. I’m desperate😭\n",

Pregnancy was okay, at least for me lol. She was born a week late and my wife had to be induced over 48 hours so that was a challange but once she was in labor she did amazing and I was so proud of my incredible wife and what she made. Everything was going well, or at least as well as it goes with a newborn. Some rough sleeping nights, feeding concerns, stomach aches but it didn't feel any different yet. This last Thursday though it hit me like a ton of bricks. This unbelievable weight fell on my chest, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I started calling people to try and hang out until I broke down with my sister in law on the phone. Since then I've had this constant feeling of hopelessness, dread, fear my life was over now, like I needed to call my friends and tell them how great it was knowing them and that I'll miss them. I hadn't cried since I was a teenager and I haven't had a day since the that I haven't cried. I feel like a failure, a bad father and a terrible husband. No matter how much I sleep i still feel tired and exhausted even though my wife is doing everything while I sit here scared and sorry for myself. I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. I keep hoping someone I talk to has all the answers that takes the pain away. I wish I was me again and I can't stop feeling like this is who I am now.\n",

      "Post 23: Our 14 mo refuses to nap except in the car\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a 14 mo girl who has always been the best sleeper at night, but the daytime naps is where we struggle. We followed wake windows and sleepy cues as well as having a pretty strict bedtime and schedule but no matter what her naps were always short and rarely on time. Even when she was a newborn when they should have like a 30 minute ww, she would be awake for 2 hours or so and there was nothing you could do to stop that. She has never been much of a cuddler, very independent and dislikes being rocked especially now when she has quite a will and strength to resist. She always seemed to take the best naps in the car so whenever the going got tough we would resort to this solution. However the nap situation had gotten better even in her crib and for a while it was great until she decided to start dropping down to one nap. For example if we planned for two and her sleepy cues were showing around 10-10:30 a.m. she’d fall asleep no issue, wake up 30-45 mins later and then refuse her afternoon nap. So I pushed her nap to one around noon hoping it would help. Now she just likes to refuse the nap altogether until we cave and put her in the car after an hour or more of trying. Yesterday she didn’t want to nap in the crib so we tried not to put her in the car, she was very happy, no issues there and she only fell asleep when we had to get in the car around 4 p.m. And then she slept for half an hour again. Is this some sort of regression, what the hell is it and can I help her get through this quicked and go back to napping an age appropriate amount? \n",

      "\n",
      "Our daughter is 7 weeks old. Our son, when she first arrived was buzzing with excitement, he helped us choose the name and the nickname and was counting down the days until she would arrive with us. First week he was quite happy too. Then the second week came and thinks went a bit downhill. The baby would cry, we call her June bug at home, and he would say \"I don't like it when June bug cries, she is annoying\". Asking if she can stay with grandparents until she grows up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last weekend at the park he fell over, massive tantrum because my husband wasn't tending to him because he was holding the baby and he wanted him to do it. But he wants whoever is holding the baby to do stuff for him, help him find his shoes, get him a snack when he usually doesn't have a preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he's been saying things like she looks like a bug. Wanting to sleep in our bed, we are both tired waking up multiple times throughout the night so this has been particularly difficult. Then today I was holding her, he came over pretending to stroke her feet and pinched her. I did send him straight to his room, something we don't usually do to have a clear consequence. Only for 2 minutes then we spoke about nice hands around the baby and being nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Husband and I are swamped, we don't think we have neglected him at all since the baby. His routine stayed the same, we take him to the park everyday after school and bring the baby, we do movie night every weekend still. Husband and I alternate doing more solo activities with him and he's constantly playing football with one of us in the garden which he loves at the moment and we take him to swimming. I know these are basic things to do for your kid but I am mentioning them to show, we have kept his day to day the same and have tried our hardest to not make him feel replaced and kept him very involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are just worried about him not warming up to her and we don't want the pinching behaviour to become a thing so we are having to be extra vigilant. \n",

      "My fiance and I have an 8 week old baby. Its not my first rodeo, but its his first child. She's a lot fussier than my first, and I'll admit i was really lucky the first time around to have such a quiet baby.\n",

      "\n",
      "My fiance was more responsive at first, but after talking to his sister and mom, they said she needs to \"cry it out\" or else she will be too attached and be a clingy baby. It will be \"worse for us\" by the time she goes to daycare/has a sitter (we plan on getting a sitter around 3-4 mos due to work).\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him I disagreed with that, I never let my son cry it out too long because I knew he NEEDED something, even if it was just comfort. \n",

      "Lately, my fiance just let's our daughter cry at the top of her lungs. Its devastating.  My anxiety gets high, my chest hurts, and of course I pick her up to see what she needs. One morning, he let her cry it out in his arms while he fell asleep. I tried yelling over the crying and eventually plucked her from his arms. It was a 3 day fight. My approach was wrong and i apologized, but I feel strongly about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told him do his research on newborns and crying it out. He said I believe too much on the internet. Its about raising the kids based on generational practices and belief. \n",

      "Edit: Thank you everyone, I'm so grateful for all the insight and advice. She has a pediatrician appointment in 2 days, and I will make sure he comes so we get completely objective and educated feedback for him to hear first hand.

This community has been really helpful for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "He loves her very much, he thinks he's doing the right thing because his mom and sister say so. And in our argument he has blatantly said he takes their word over mine because they've raised kids, and he doesnt \"trust my judgment as a parent\" because my eldest has trouble listening and remembering. My \"disciplinary style isn't working\", and I tell him CIO has nothing to do with discipline but everything to do with nurturing and bonding. Thats a story for another day, I'm picking my battles and trying to overcome each one. Right now its CIO for newborn, thats the most crucial. Next is choosing the family he made and not the one he was born into. \n",

      "My oldest is 7 and my middle is 5. 7 year old has a friend who is here every other week due to split custody and whenever he’s here we literally cannot work. My oldest has even been late to baseball practice because his friend literally tugs him to his house straight from the bus stop. I’ve talked with his mom multiple times and she knows our schedule. This kid also says “why is your room always so messy? I don’t play with anything except my iPad so I don’t make a mess.” And always asking why my child can’t play, especially when we’re out the door by 4:30 to go work.\n",
      "Middle child, 5, is homeschooled. There is a friend a few buildings over who is the same age. She takes the bus to the local public school about half the days and skips many days randomly because her mom leaves for work early and her older brother “forgets” to get her up on time. She will come over when my daughter is in the middle of her lessons and I’ve explained our schedule multiple times. English 8:30-9:30, phonics until 10:30 lunch at 11 with dad, then math until 1. I am autistic as are my two oldest ADHD keeping a specific schedule and chore chart helps mitigate the chaos. I’m 36ish weeks pregnant now and have been so exhausted recently. 5 year old had placement testing today and friends was knocking on the door at 8:45, so 15 minutes after missing the bus. I texted mom and she said she’s supposed to be at school, they’re moving this week and everything is chaos, etc. I didn’t respond. I did however unplug the doorbell. I also told her we cannot play today because it’s a busy day. Cue knocking every 15-20 minutes for the next two hours until my husband got off for lunch and told her she needs to go home. Again.\n",
      "Oldest got home from school and friend immediately wants to play, we have to say no. It’s the first really hot day of the year so my husband decided to take everyone for ice cream for dinner after doing their chores. Oldest didn’t finish but we left around 4:30. Get home and say oldest needs to finish chores first. He just has to pick up his marble track and laundry from the floor and put away his puzzle pieces and legos. Cue “I can’t do it all by myself!” And a floor tantrum. Friends start ringing the doorbell and when that doesn’t work knocking every 15 seconds. When we don’t answer they start going around to all the windows and banging on them. Then they start bouncing a ball against the side of the house. I texted friends mom “hey, [oldest] can’t play right now, he has to pick up his room.” Response “oh, that’s okay [friend] can’t play help! He wants to play with [oldest] as much as possible since he’s only here every other week.”\n",
      "I’m frazzled and don’t want other people’s kids in my home. I just shampooed the carpets, I don’t want spills and noise, I’m trying to get into a comfortable place for labor and everything that’s coming soon. Next thing I know friend comes barging in and I’m in the middle of changing my underwear in a nightgown with no bra on. My husband came busting out of the bathroom and laid into this kid. What if I had a newborn? What if he was trying to sleep? What if I was in the middle of breastfeeding him and everything was out? I’m also a full time student on top of all this and my school doesn’t allow for part time enrollment and I am struggling way more than I should because of this.\n",

      "We moved here because it’s subsidized housing so I expect there to be things that are off. I think our unit is 80% so 20% of rent is subsidized, but I’m fairly certain they go all the way down to 10% or so, so I know most people who live here are working their butts off otherwise they lose the subsidy and I also know childcare is expensive and likely unaffordable for many. On Friday I fell asleep at 1 and my husband came down to work in the living room to keep an eye on the kids at home, and last Tuesday I was in the hospital with a BP of 161/101 and a blood glucose of 45. I have a heart murmur and POTS-like symptoms because of it. I know what and how much I can handle and usually prepare for that, extra kids in my house and banging on my door are not accounted for. 5 year olds friend is always asking for food and we just got a bunch of snacks from our church and drinking water. Half the water bottles and snacks are gone after less than a week so we have to go overdraft our account so we have clean drinking water. Water is NOT worth $34 but we can’t go without. I’m trying to save for a pro one big plus water filter as having done the math it would cost about the same per year to replace the filters as what we are spending on water at Sam’s.\n",

      "I know. Call me crazy. But that was the first time in my adult life with insomnia that I actually fell asleep without any sleep aid as soon as I got into bed. I remember being so surprised by it and believing that maybe my insomnia was gone, but as my daughters has gotten older and slept better I'm apparently not exhausted enough to get any non sleep aided sleep. I think I have a high tolerance to melatonin,\n",
      "I take 10 mg at a time with no relief. I'm still breast feeding so I can't really take anything more, and she still wakes at night so I don't want to be too groggy. But I'm just not sleeping. She sleeps 6-7 hour stretches and I'm lucky if I sleep as t all. I used to take prescription sleep aids for insomnia but stopped in 2020 with concerns for my long term health and family history of dementia. Since then I used a million supplement combos and on the really bad nights muscle relaxers. When I got pregnant I took unison every night (approved by my doctor). My daughter is 6 months old now, is anyone in a similar boat? I'm so tired but my brain keeps going. I'm not overly anxious during the day, and I don't feel like I'm super anxious at night I just can't stop thinking. Open to suggestions! \n",

My partner and I have been together 8 years, have lived together on our farm for 5 years and we were both super nervous/excited when we found out! My partner was especially excited when we found out we were having a boy. He was super supportive and understand during my whole pregnancy. He came to important appts and when he didn’t come to apts he ALWAYS asked how our boy was doing. \n",
      "My partner isn’t very emotional but when our son was born he even shed a tear and was happy we delivered a healthy boy and there weren’t any complications. \n",
      "The first couple weeks pp he was super involved and very available for me and checked in on us and helped w the baby. \n",
      "At 1 month pp tho he had to get surgery on his ankle that put him on crutches for 2 whole months afterwards… this is where I noticed a shift. \n",
      "He was miserable, and hes a very active man and stays busy constantly with his hobby’s/projects around the house and it was tough on me with a newborn but our son really was/is such an easy going baby. We didn’t have many sleepless night and I generally knew what he needed every time once we got his feeding worked out. \n",
      "Since then tho he was distant tho w our son, even once he off the crutches and was generally back to his normal hobbies. He says hello to him, checks in on him when I pick him up after work, puts him to bed sometimes and when I work late on some days he has no problem being with him but I don’t notice a real “bond” yet. \n",
      "Again, he has never been a very emotional person and it never bothered me but it makes me feel sad for our son bc I feel like he should want to play and interact with him more? \n",
      "I do think he fell into some sort of depression after his surgery and hasn’t really shook that yet but idk. He pays plenty of attention to our dog, so it bums me and it’s put a real strain on our relationship that was generally pretty solid before our baby arrived! \n",
      "\n",

I was holding my 4 week old football style, and idk my ankle just gave up on me. Just bent inwards and I fell forwards. I did everything in my power to protect her, and she seems to be okay.

I could have landed on top of my daughter, I could have landed worse and broken her little limbs, she could have hit her head hard.   And now, I have to figure out how to take care of both of them without putting much weight on my ankle. Thank God I kept my boot from the last time I fell, so I can at least use that. \n",

And it's true, I cut my finger pretty bad when we first moved in together, I fell in a job site with him and sprained my other ankle. Fell with my son in my arms cause I lost my balance standing up, he was also okay but was scared. Fell in the snow this January and fractured my elbow.

She still wakes up at least once a night and cries for me to come comfort her back to sleep. Tonight (and several nights on and off) she put up a fight at bedtime. I told her several times if she didn’t lay down and cover up, I was going to walk out and let her go to sleep on her own. She continued to play and kick her blankets off, so I walked out of the room. She screamed for 20+ minutes, and I feel awful. I had hoped at some point she would just grow out of wanting to be comforted to sleep, but I don’t see an end in sight. Am I a terrible mom for letting her cry it out tonight? How do I break this habit without traumatizing her? She’s the youngest of 3, and I never had this problem with my older 2 children. \n",

When he is at baseline he is calm, focused, and keeps us laughing at his vocabulary and amazing maturity level through the day. But he has always had trouble sleeping; trouble getting to sleep, trouble staying asleep, trouble with timing of naps and all of that. Now he usually goes to bed sometime between 8-9, and wakes up sometime between 7:30-8:30 the next morning. \n",

The other day my parents watched him for the day so I could catch up on school, and I guess he fell asleep in the car on the ride home for 15-20min around 7:00. He was awake that night until 11, would not fall asleep. Then he woke up the next day super hyper and wired, where he’s constantly stimming and making these whispering-to-himself sounds, mouth popping sounds that drive me up a wall to hear all day, talks to me in a weird high pitched whiny but fake voice (like he’s purposely putting on this other voice and acting whiny on purpose), gets clumsy where he’s rolling around for no reason on the floor or bed and just sort of hanging onto stuff and flopping over things and what I guess is some sort of physical stimming. He cries super easily when he gets this way too, like any small thing can set him off. But other than that his mood is ok but he’s permanently in this goofy purposely annoying mode where he just will not be serious and cannot focus on anything. Spits all over himself, it’s just a ton of things he usually never does but when he’s this way he does it all day nonstop. \n",

      "So anyway, he was like that from the time he woke up. Woke up at like 7:45 the next day. So although he doesn’t typically nap anymore, I got him down for one at around 2 because I knew he needed sleep. Well, then he stayed up til 10:30 that night and now today woke up even worse, just in this permanent mode of looking around the room weirdly and talking differently and being clumsy and intentionally annoying, and just acting like a totally different person. Usually when this happens he stays like this for a long time. Like at least a couple of weeks. I don’t know how to get him caught back up on sleep. If I do nap he will just delay his bedtime more, if I don’t do a nap he goes to sleep early or at normal time but it doesn’t seem to help either. I’ve tried both ways, giving him a nap to “catch up” and just resuming normal schedule, and both ways he just stays in this mode for a long time. \n",

We used to think it was something dietary but now I’ve realized it’s for sure sleep. Just can’t seem to figure out how to fix it. If anyone has a toddler that acts totally different when tired I’d love to hear about it because everyone I talk to acts like they can’t relate. And what do I do to help him? He doesn’t have any disabilities that we know of and no diagnosed mental health issues. I hate to say this but I just really can’t stand how he acts when he’s like this. I start missing the smart, thoughtful, loving, sweet boy he normally is because it’s like I lose him and he becomes a totally different person. It hurts my heart and also makes me get so irritable with him where I just don’t even want to be around him because he’s just out of control. :( \n",

      "\n",
      "My daughter (2.5yo) has been a decent sleeper since she was a baby. She would get a small sleep regression that would last a week or so once in a while. However in the last 1-2 months her sleep regression seems to be her new normal. We moved to a new house 2 months ago. In the beginning she seemed to do ok, she would go to sleep by herself after our usual nighttime routine. Then her school ended a week later and her sleep also changed. She would require someone to sing to her or just to stay in her room until she fell asleep. She would also wake up in middle of night crying and screaming. She’s only getting 8-9 hours on a good night. She does take a 2 hour nap during the day. She used to sleep around 9-10 hours a night and an almost 2 hour nap. Initially she says she was scared of monsters and the dark. We tried night light, stickers on walls, keeping her room the same, same night time routine, explaining she’s safe, etc. sometimes it takes singing for over an hour until she’s asleep. It’s been really tiring to say the least for her dad and I. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! \n",

Before we had the twins my husband and I had been married five years and were \"stare into each others eyes\" kind of in love with each other. I still deeply love my husband, but all my energy is on the kids. The last few months he has expressed to me a lot that he feels neglected, and I kind of agree with him but I don't know how to change it. \n",

      "\n",
      "For the first 6 months of the twins being at home from hospital I did everything for them. I was breastfeeding and I was up 6+ times a night feeding them (they were terrible sleepers) and my husband wouldn’t even roll over to ask if I needed help. I remember sobbing and trying to get a baby to sleep for hours once, trying not to fall asleep myself while holding them, and he covered his ears with his pillow and complained in the morning about how tired he was. He treated me terribly. I should’ve asked for what I needed but I was so tired I couldn’t even find the words. I have since told him how this made me feel, multiple times. But he doesn’t get it. I actually told him this again today and he said, “you were breastfeeding, what could I have done to help?”. After all these months he still doesn't get it.\n",

      "Raising twins is exhausting. Like, it's really hard. I am on all day. They don't nap at the same time. Twin A still wakes up 2+ times a night, sometimes for hours at a time. I have asked my husband to help and he will but he eventually gets angry at Twin A... as if this 1 year old is deliberately waking up in the night to annoy him? So I just stopped asking. \n",

I said yeah, I have to admit I don't have energy to give you affection. I am being touched by babies all day. Literally all day I have a baby who needs me. What I really need when he gets home from work is for him to look after me, but it's like another person walks in the door for me to look after except he mopes around if I say I don't want to have sex with him. He thinks I'm the bad guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night for example I went to bed at 8pm to get some alone time. He came into bed as well. Offered to give me a massage, which was actually just him trying to initiate sex. I refused. I went to bed that early so I could scroll mindlessly on my phone for a few hours and not be disturbed (I didn't say that... I just said I was too tired. Maybe I should have said that?). I fell asleep and at 11pm I was up for an hour with Twin A trying to get him back to sleep. When I got back to bed he tried to initiate sex again. I told him I had just been up for an hour and I'm exhausted. He left the room and slept on the lounge. I let him go, I didn't have the energy. Then in the morning he said that me ignoring him was evidence I didn't care about him. I just couldn't help but think \"and where were you when I was trying to get Twin A back to sleep?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reading this back to myself I know I would give the advice to leave him if someone else was telling me this story. But practically that's impossible. I cannot afford childcare on my own. I can't afford rent on a place big enough for me and my twins. I live five hours away from my family. Most importantly I love my husband and I want to make this work but I don't know how to give him more affection and/or show him that I can't give him what he wants right now. I'm sure as the babies grow it'll get easier, or when they're in childcare, but right now it is so hard.\n",

We were out at dinner at a pizza place on the patio- there were a few other kids around walking. My son finished most of his dinner and like most kids his age, doesn’t want to sit still. We let him down to walk around and he asked for a wing. So I gave him one. He was walking around, eating a wing, and had a very messy face and hands but was in a great mood and being really mellow. He was standing by other kids and mostly minding his own business. Just observing. We watched him the whole time and I asked my husband to watch him as well to make sure we grabbed the bone before it was too exposed, make sure he wasn’t running with it, and to make sure he didn’t try touching other kids with his messy hands. One family finished dinner and left. There was a family with a little girl, us and a solo couple with no kids left on the patio. I overheard the couple paying for this other families dinner. When the waitress went over to tell the family, she told the famiy the couple was paying for their meal because “they love the way you love your child.” And my heart sank. I told my husband that it made me reflect on our parenting and his response was “well I didn’t like that he was walking around, messy and eating.” And I’m like why didn’t you say or do anything then? I think the couple paying for the dinner of the other family and the comment they made, just made me feel like I was failing at parenting or doing it wrong.

I was an alcoholic before I knew it and by my sophomore year of college I was faking ADHD to get meds from a sketchy doc in Queens, eating them like tic tacs and then drinking myself till blackout just to sleep. It all looked sexy and fun on the outside. It was hell.\n",

      "I got sober (unwillingly) in 2016 and I couldn’t keep much time together. I got pregnant with my first during Covid and quickly sought a doctor to prescribe me adderall once again.

I am ashamed he married a woman he doesn’t truly know. I have hid this for our entire relationship of 3.5 years. I said our vows in front of family after an all night binge. I was acting like a freak the entire morning before the ceremony. We fought. I cried a lot and was over the top emotional - just not in a good “wow I can’t wait to be married!” way. I was just a wreck. I feel like the ultimate fraud.\n",

I don’t even get things done. I stare at my housework. I chase the high I had once. The tingle. God I miss that feeling. I am addicting to popping one every hour. I’m amazed I’m not dead. I’m also prescribed lorazepam which I run though in a week as well. I’m not present. I’m a complete zombie and isolate myself. I hate the mother I’ve become.\n",

I’m the daughter of a sober amazing mother (25 years), I’ve been in and out of recovery, I’ve felt amazing clean before many times over. I had a father die due to the disease of addiction and mental illness to suicide at 18. I am terrified of not being around for my kids.  But I am so so so scared to be honest. It’s reached a point where it isn’t an option to be honest. I’m in too deep and have been for years.\n",

Alcohol over parenting responsibilities; she saw things she shouldn't have seen and neither of them ever stood up for her. She loves them nonetheless and misses them even though we barely hear from them. They're inconsistent and I think that affects her too.

Overall, he loves to sing, dance, give kisses, interact & be his happy self on top of cutting more teeth at the bottom (which I think contributes to his fussiness) but when she has a remark she makes me feel like I’m the only parent in the world with a child who acts out & that I “marked” him with my ways.

Bedtime has turned into a battle, where she cries and cries for us to stay in her room with her. She recently transitioned out of her crib, but this was going on long before that as well. I thought the big girl bed might give her some excitement and independence but no, the minute we say good night and go to leave she loses her shit.  We’ve tried telling her she can read/play until her light Hatch light goes off but she doesn’t care. It’s more about us leaving than anything else. Sometimes I lay with her and she falls asleep after a while but I really don’t want to give up my entire night by laying in her bed every night so she doesn’t throw a fit. \n",

He has never slept through the night, in fact his sleep has been about the same since birth, if not maybe even a little worse, waking every 2-3hrs at night.

My toddler still babbles in her baby talk. It really does sound like she's trying to talk, babbles while looking directly at me, will babble in response when I ask her a question etc. She can say \"uh oh\" \"mama\" \"dada\" and is able to wave \"hi\" and \"bye\" in the correct context. My mom and sister made me think that she was behind because they would say how their babies were walking by 9-10 months and were talking by 16 months. Oh yeah my toddler also is able to use utensils when eating, she will however have some of her food fall off before it gets to her mouth and she'll end up using her hands instead, once again both my sister and mom said that their babies were able to use utensils by 12 months with no problem. My baby was always a little bit late to achieve her milestones but she always hit them, she didn't walk until 15 months, didn't roll over until 5 months, didn't learn to effectively crawl until 8 months, didn't sit up unassisted until 6 months. Seeing other babies on tiktok, IG, or FB achieve their milestones way sooner than mine did really make me concerned for her. I know comparison is the their of joy and it really is, I don't want to compare my baby to other random babies but sometimes I wonder if I'm doing something wrong.

She will get out of bed 10-15 times. She is probably getting about 9 hours sleep now as opposed to 13. \n",

      "Backstory for context: My daughter (10 months) was born with complications and spent 11 days in NICU. It was a traumatic birth and I was not able to be in the NICU with her much as I had a level 4 tear and could not walk or sit to travel to the hospital which was 30 minutes from our home. Due to our early days of separation, we had a difficult time with nursing and I was also not a big producer, she has been 90% bottle fed donor breast milk since day 1 (shout out to all the amazing and generous mamas who shared with us! 💕)\n",
      "Baby girl was always fed a bottle at naptime and bedtime laying on her side. This is how she still falls asleep and really will not or cannot be convinced to nap or sleep without a bottle. She's not the best napper, but I think she's within normal ranges for number of naps and amount of time she naps for. \n",
      "My question is, has anyone else had experience with a baby who will only nap or sleep if there is a bottle given and how did that look as you started to wean and transition to eating more solids/less milk per day? Perhaps this is completely normal and she will find her own way to fall asleep without a bottle or maybe giving her a bottle to sleep is fine? FTM here, obviously, lol. \n",
      "Another related but separate question I have is that she pretty much will only stay asleep if I'm right next to her (we co-sleep on a floor bed). This is ok a lot of the time because I'm also exhausted as a single mother providing sole care 24/7 with no local family or much of a support system. However, I am barely able to get anything done because if I get up after she falls asleep to do dishes, take a shower, make a call, etc. she almost always will wake up after about 5 minutes of me being out of the room. The only exception is when she is in the car seat and we are driving somewhere, then she will fall asleep for long periods of time, without a bottle and doesn't wake with external noise or movement. She's not huge on contact napping, but I used to put her in the carrier and she would fall asleep or be happy while I got some stuff done. She's almost 25lbs now and has less tolerance for that anymore as well as I physically cannot carry her around for longer periods of time (I'm 5'2\", petite frame).\n",

We'd get her situated and she'd promptly go back to her own ear and fall asleep. We just thought it was cute, a little quirky, and a kind of funny, so it never really bothered us.

However I'm worried that 1) our nanny either needs to take an extended leave or will be generally unreliable due to the family issues and 2) we're in a share, so if our toddler doesn't get into another daycare by the time we need care for #2, we'll be in a 3 kid share which I'm not sure nanny can handle (the other baby is also on daycare waitlists but obviously no idea when they'll get in).\n",

      "My husband and I got married last October. Now we are expecting and our due date is August 17th. We are currently in a nice, one bedroom apartment which is fairly affordable for the income we are making. My husband seems to be leaning more toward staying in the one bedroom (our lease is up December 1st so we have to make a decision fairly quick), but I am leaning more toward the two bedroom option. Also, my parents (particularly my mom) are pushing the two bedroom because they are worried for our “sanity” and for us as a couple when it comes to sharing a one bedroom with an infant for a year as they grow fast and it may be difficult to have privacy. They are more so worried for me with all the hormonal changes, lack of sleep, and postpartum depression. They are putting a lot of pressure on me and making me worried to stay in a one bedroom. However, I don’t want to just make a quick decision about moving if we can’t afford it (depending on how expensive the two bedroom is) since once you are stuck in a lease, you’re stuck. I also don’t want to fall prey to my people pleasing tendencies and just get a two bedroom because I want to get my parents off my back about it. Obviously this should be a joint decision between my husband and I. But I am stressing because baby will be here soon and our lease is up soon so it feels we need to make a pretty quick decision. My husband is such a processor though and I don’t want to heap my stress onto him and add pressure to him but at the same time…we kind of need to hurry this up. Sorry for my rant!! \n",

For my infant, who will be 12 months, should I buy her a full size crib or just skip to the twin sized bed? If we get a twin I want something I feel safer with her in that she couldn’t get out (like a crib with taller rails) and that my toddler cannot get into either. I imagine I would have to get her a twin bed soon too so I don’t wanna buy a whole crib and mattresss to then go buy a twin but she also frequently needs us to lay with her to fall asleep.

      "\n",
      "Also, we didn't buy the uppababy bassinet stand, I thought dropping $150 on a wood stand was a bit crazy, but someone ended up giving us theirs second hand, and honestly it's been a huge help and big part of our routine.  It's so easy to wheel your baby in the bassinet and transfer from the stroller the stand. If you have the uppababy stroller and bassinet attachment, buy the stand instead of a separate bassinet, it works the same and is great.\n",

      "**Boba Wrap Carrier**\n",
      "\n",
      "I had never heard of these, but I work from home, and wanted a hands-free way to hold the baby while freeing up my hands to write emails, or doing things around the house.  This thing far exceeded expectations and has been absolutely AMAZING, and probably hands down the best purchase of all baby stuff for our first 1 to 1.5 months for us. When our newborn was fussy, this was sometimes the only way we could calm her down in a mater of seconds.  We'd put her in the boba and she would fall asleep almost immediately, it was like some type of voodoo magic.  Also when she had gas, she would burp upon being put in the tight boba wrap.  They're around $40 on Amazon, and cannot recommend enough.  We ended up buying two, and I like the lighter bamboo option a lot more than the original cotton.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diapers**\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried out several brands of diapers.  I feel this is a very personal experience, and every baby has a different shape and fit, but this was our experience, ranked from Best to Worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Up & Up (Target Brand) 5/5:**  We bought these based on them being rated as the Consumer Reports top pick, and they absolutely did not disappoint.  They're soft, absorbant, have an excellent elastic waist, aren't too bulky, aesthetically appealing, and on top of that are an excellent value, the cheapest of this list.  Was very pleasantly surprised and will be our go-to diaper moving forward beyond size N and 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Huggies Little Snuggles 5/5:** A very close second to Up & Up from Target, we like them equally as much, but the value put Target slightly ahead.  Same as above, fantastic fit, great elastic band, absorbant, and all around a great diaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Coterie 4/5:** We had read and heard so much about Coterie diapers, and it was actually our first purchase of diaper brand for our baby before she was born.  Don't get me wrong, they're very nice/soft, certainly a premium product, but to be honest they're not THAT nice.  They are no better than the above two, and to be honest I prefer using the Up & Up or Huggies diapers over the Coterie.  Apart from that they're expensive, and even if you can afford them, it's crazy to spend this premium $$$ on these diapers when there are cheaper options that I think are better.  These cost 2x the Huggies and 3x the Up&Up, and when you're using 8-10 diapers per day, that adds up really quickly, and not worth it in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Pamper Swadlers 3/5:** A lot of our friends use this diaper and swear by them, but simply didn't work for us.  Like Huggies they're a major brand and trusted (I think they use them in the hospitals?), but we simply didn't love them.  They're a lot bigger and bulkier than the Huggies, and the Up & Up for sure.  And apart from that, in the fist 6 weeks of having our baby, she maybe had about 4-5 blowouts, and they were almost always in the Pampers.  I felt like they fit her too loose, and we had to pull the waist band too tight.  They're not bad diapers, but not our favorite.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Millie Moon 1/5:** These were definitely our least favorite diapers of the bunch.  They're marketed as a premium diaper (like Coterie), but I don't understand why.  The fit is absolutely terrible, the velcro sucks, and they're pricey.  Not much more to say, just wouldn't recommend and all of the above were far better.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pee Pads**\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, same as puppy pee pads.  These have been essential for us so far, and we use them daily.  Most importantly they're amazing on the go as part of your diaper bag for a change, but we use them at home as well.  Most often she doesn't soil them each change, and we reuse one 4-5 times before tossing in the trash, however when she does, it's zero stress and super easy disposal and clean up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Baby Wipes**\n",
      "\n",
      "We love the Honest Baby Wipes - clean ingredients, slightly more expensive than say Pampers or Huggies, but can find for good price when buying in bulk (which you'll need, they go fast).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bottles**\n",
      "\n",
      "We're very happy with the Comotomo Baby Bottles.  We didn't want plastic, and these silicone bottles seemed like a great alternative.  Have no other bottle experience to compare them to, but very happy with them 100%.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**What We Didn't Buy**\n",
      "\n",
      "As mentioned there's so much advice out there, and it's hard to digest what you really need and what you really don't.  I feel like we prepared well, but didn't buy EVERYTHING that people tell you to buy.  We certainly didn't buy a baby wipe warmer, our baby doesn't mind the cold wipes.  At first I didn't buy a bottle warmer either, instead I put the milk bags in a bowl and used our kettle to pour hot water of them which worked perfectly.  Eventually I caved and bought a cheap one on Amazon for convenience, but not a necessity (we also discovered our baby doesn't mind drinking cold or room temperature milk).\n",
      "\n",
      "We also didn't buy a special diaper bag.  This was the hardest for me to research, as I felt all diaper bags out there are terrible looking, and there wasn't good info.  I read a post that said most parents bring way too much stuff in their diaper bag, and I think this might be true from my experience so far.  I wound up using a backpack I already owned that I really liked, that was quite small at 12 liters.  I'd recommend slightly larger, maybe 14-16 liters, but in our bag we have 4-5 diapers, change of clothes, baby wipes, poop bags (dog poop bags, another great item), small diaper cream spray, burp cloth, pee pad, pacifier, and other items.  Really haven't needed much more space, and fits perfectly under the stroller\n",

      "Hello. \n",
      "We are currently facing the biggest (and I think only) sleep regression in our 2.5 yo toddler’s life. After 3-weeks break in daycare his separation anxiety went haywire and he screams during the night. We’ve tried many things that didn’t work. I’m not comfortable letting him cry it out. \n",
      "He’s also facing some incoming stresses (has a medical procedure at the end of August, starts new kindergarten in September and I’m due with baby #2 in December). Life’s just hard for him right now. \n",
      "Right now he has a floor bed with an extra mattress next for me when he wakes up at night. He sleeps through the night maybe once a week. I’m really tired of trying to find a solution without sleeping with him too much, going back and forth, listening to him scream, hoping he would fall asleep on his own, listening to my partner saying I shouldn’t cosleep ‘because what after the baby #2 comes’. \n",
      "I was going to do sidecar in bedroom after birth and then move to floor bed at 2-3 months in baby’s #2 own room and cosleep with new baby. (Me and my partner sleep apart and I’m hesitant about coming back to bedroom but the bed will be more comfortable as I have a mattress on the floor right now too). \n",
      "Now I’m facing the problem of me cosleeping with toddler and adding #2 which is going to make things difficult - sleeping on the floor postpartum won’t be possible (what if I have c-section?) and having a newborn on the floor bed with a toddler is not safe at all. \n",
      "I’m thinking about buying large floor bed for baby #2 and putting him in a crib at first, some armchair to feed or something and then welcoming toddler in baby’s room if he needs me. \n",
      "I don’t know. My partner is strongly against cosleeping, he thinks I should do CIO but then is annoyed at toddler screaming (which yeah, I’m annoyed too but it’s me doing all the work at night). \n",
      "So what was your set up? Please give some suggestions, what has worked and not worked for you, how life was like after #2, is there some solution I didn’t think of, I don’t know. Help I’m tired and can’t think straight.\n",

My 2.5 y old was a super fussy, reflux prone, have to be rocked and held 24/7 type of baby. I’m talking hours and hours of rocking her in a dark house next to a running dryer machine every day to get her to sleep. She was on reflux meds because she would projectile vomit randomly. She had to sleep sitting up. I cut out dairy, oats, soy, and eggs from my diet. 8 months old she was diagnosed with infantile scoliosis. I remember it being a very dark time. \n",

My newborn will not sleep anywhere, even when I am holding her rocking her while feeding her, she falls into a deep sleep then kicks her legs and squirms till she is awake again. Today she screamed for 40 minutes bloody murder until I finally took her in my room, swaddled her with blasting white noise and fed her and snuck out of the room. This isn’t a nice way to do it because I have to leave my toddler in the living room alone watching tv and praying she doesn’t get into anything or start screaming until I can get her sister down and come out of the room. Yesterday I held her for 2 hours rocking and breastfeeding her while she slept. I did this twice. So two long naps where I can’t get up to get water, use the bathroom, or keep my toddler from wrecking the house and drawing all over the walls and furniture. \n",

      "\n",
      "For context: Since birth, my daughter (20mo) has always been a contact napper/sleeper which progressed into snuggles in bed once she got older (around 14mo) and we never had any issues except the odd afternoon where we'd miss the golden window of sleepiness and then we'd run into issues but it would never take more than an hour MAX to get her to sleep. (Note: We have bed shared at night since birth)\n",

      "Now, here comes the issue. We had another baby 5 weeks ago. Ever since then... good lord have mercy on our souls. Nap time and bedtime has become worse than pulling teeth. We haven't changed our routines at all. I modify (when I can) baby's schedule so I can be hands on with my toddler when it comes to sleep times and still provide her with snuggles. She will hit, slap, bite, kick and scream till she literally vomits when it comes to sleeping now. It will take anywhere from two to FIVE hours to get her to sleep and she usually will pass out from pure exhaustion. What in the hell are we doing wrong? We've tried struggle snuggles, an hour of calming before trying, we've watched her like hawks for sleepy cues. She could be falling asleep playing but as soon as she realizes shes going to bed, all hell breaks loose. She wakes at least once a night, which is a normal for her and she'll (usually) go back to sleep immediately. The only difference to her sleep schedule is I no longer sleep in bed with her, as I'm out on the couch tending to the newborn. Husband can't sleep with her on work nights because he wakes waaaay too early for her. \n",

(9-10pm, wakes anywhere between 6-8am depending on how loud dad is when getting ready for work, nap is usually 1230 but ranges lately from 11am-3pm due to fussing) It wasn't an issue before hand so I'm not sold on it being the issue but I understand that everything changes in the toddler world. \n",

I think her behavior now is pretty typical of her age. I can’t complain about her sleep, she’s not a picky eater, she’s just the normal whiney, clingy, crying at the drop of a hat, frustrated she can’t communicate, walking and falling and crying, won’t let me get anything done around the house, into everything, throwing herself on the floor crying when told no kinda toddler/baby and man, I hate it!

      "My baby girl just turned 5 months. She used to sleep pretty good swaddled. I’d do about 2-3 night feeds and get 5-7 hours of sleep combined. Once she started rolling I slowly transitioned her to a sleep sack. I’d do one arm out alternating arms for about 2 weeks then I just switched her to the zipadee swaddle. Her startle reflux is bad, and ever since I’ve been lucky to even get 3 hours of sleep a night. I’ll nurse her to sleep in my bed then slowly place her in the bassinet, but once her arm falls she’s pretty much alert and knows she’s in the bassinet. She will wiggle and I’ll hold her arms in place till she stops, then a minute later it starts again and we battle this for 30 minutes to an hour. I try my best to not have her arm move when I transition her but it’s almost impossible when I only have two arms to hold her legs and head. Now I am sick with a bad cold, which I think she caught as well and I was up from 12:30 am last night till 7am going through the same process of her wiggling. I think I got about an hour total until I just gave up after multiple break downs and co slept with her. Please don’t judge me. Her father can’t really help either because she will only nurse back to sleep and refuses to take a bottle. I’m alone in this, and it’s been 3 weeks battling the swaddle transition and it hasn’t gotten better. I got better sleep during the newborn stage and it’s really taking a mental and physical toll on me not getting any sleep. She only sleeps well if we co sleep but I don’t sleep well because I’m too scared when we do. I dont know if its the 4 month sleep regression, swaddle, or she just wants to co sleep. If anyone has been in this similar situation and has any tips I’d GREATLY appreciate it. I’m desperate for anything.

My wife and I do the best we can to have him sleep properly but still, he wakes up every 2 hours every night, and in rare occasions, he refuses to go to sleep and stays awake for 1 or 2 hours, which obviously results in us losing precious rest that we need to deal with the day.\n",

      "The thing is that by doing that, I ended up extremely tired.

It was in the second's case where the incident happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I was closing the cabinets door, I noticed his hand on the outermost edge, but I did not notice his other hand holding the other edge with his fingers inside the crevice between the door and the hinges. I continued slowly closing the door and noticed he started to cry, so my first thought was that he was crying out of frustration for not being able to play with the door (he likes opening and closing them) so I pushed a bit more to close (not too hard though) in hopes he would release his hand, and that's when his crying increased in volume. I put the things I had on my other hand on the shelve beside me so I could use my too hands to lift him and that's when I noticed his other hand and where his fingers were.\n",

      "At that moment I felt a combination of rage (at myself) for not noticing and guilt, and later tears filled my eyes as I rushed to check his fingers. Luckily, he just had a tiny mark in one of his fingers because of the pressure of the edge of the door, but I first put his hand under cold water to calm the pain, and had him test his grip and everything. Despite him being ok, and after seeing that no major damage was done, was when the guilt thoughts came to me.\n",

My marriage was falling apart and he found comfort in becoming good friends with other women while ignoring me so it made me even more of an angrier person. One night my baby did not want to sleep at all and i knew my toddler would be awake in an hour by the time she did get to sleep so i laid her in my bed next to me and scrolled on my phone instead of sleeping. I stopped scrolling to check on her and she had glowing red eyes and all sharp teeth grinning at me coming closer and closer and i jumped out of bed and rubbed my eyes to see she was still fast asleep but for the next two weeks I was terrified to be near her or alone with her. I had been having previous hallucinations before that but they were never that bad. I also spent two months contemplating on my life so I made an urgent doctors appointment and sobbed everything to the doctor and even after 3 years I can’t go unmedicated. I should note i divorced him and found myself so i am almost back to myself and don’t have a mean bone in my body.\n",

Takes showers whenever he wants. Never asks. Just disappears or falls asleep. I had surgery a week ago and am still the one sleeping with our toddler and we were awake literally all night last night. I have not slept more than an hour. I’m not allowed to pick her up or lift anything over 10lbs. I just said how tired I am and what did he just do? Grabbed a pillow and laid down on the couch to take a nap. After he slept soundly all night by himself. Maybe it’s wild but I don’t just assume that his 65 year old parents (who are not in the best condition) should be responsible for her while we’re visiting. She’s a feral little wild child and their house is tile, with lots of sharp corners and glass furniture.

When I talk about going to the gym, I talk about how I want to feel strong, and I want to run fast.

She will just gulp down the message whole. She loves dresses and (kids) makeup, nail polish and jewellry and dressing up a bit fancy, we have never had an issue with it but I have always said that wearing makeup and nail polish is about making you feel good inside, not about looking good for other people.\n",

      "\n",
      "Eldest children, did you resent (or not resent) the amount of responsibility placed on you for the household or babysitting? How could your parents have done better? \n",
      "I had a friend growing up who was the eldest girl/second child in her family. She resented how much childcare and parenting responsibility was placed on her. \n",
      "I want to prevent doing anything to create that kind of resentment in my eldest children. We have six children. My eldest is 12(m)who I will refer to as J. My youngest is 1yo(m). \n",
      "While I believe that responsibilities and chores are a good thing to a certain extent, I don’t want to overdo it. Kid’s responsibilities should be balanced with playtime, solitude if they need it, and fun that isn’t always punctuated by constant childcare/little ones interfering, but it can be hard to balance all of that in a small house with a lot of kids. \n",
      "I want to describe what I ask of him and make sure it doesn’t sound like too much. \n",
      "J is a good brother- protective, willing to help, absolutely adores the 1yo. He never bullies, and he occasionally does big brother things I wouldn’t ask for. Ex: this last week he spent an hour helping his little sister learn to ride her bike and was proud of himself.\n",
      "To be clear, nearly everything I ask of him besides regular chores is to lighten my load for a few minutes because a pressing task or another child needs me. \n",
      "The things I ask him for: chores, of which he has roughly the same amount as the other boys (10 and 8.) I often ask him to hold the baby while I complete a task, usually cooking, or I ask him to take over and watch the food temporarily. I occasionally ask him to put a diaper on the baby after I take him out of the tub. Rarely I ask him to change a wet diaper if I’m drowning, never dirty diapers, as I don’t think that’s a fair ask. \n",
      "I often ask (and he often volunteers) to take the 1yo outside and play with him/supervise his happy baby wanderings. (We live in the country so it’s pretty safe besides ants and rocks to trip over and over-curious goats.) J loves doing this, generally. \n",
      "His biggest chore currently is to clean the boy’s bathroom daily, which involves wiping down sink/toilet, taking out the trash, picking up bath toys and towels, and replacing the hand towel with a clean one. \n",
      "As for babysitting besides the outside playtime, I never ask him to babysit the 1yo unless I need to be outside for 20-30 minutes or so without him. I’ve never left him in a situation where he couldn’t come find me if he needed me to help with the 1yo.\n",
      "I have rarely left him in charge of the 4yo and 6yo while I run a quick errand. (Maybe 6-10 times total, ever.) \n",
      "The other chores are spread among the children and are mainly decluttering/tidying certain areas, sweeping one room, wiping a table, clearing a small surface, tidying their own dressers, feeding the cats or the chickens, etc. J is supposed to wash the boy’s clothes twice a week and all three boys put their own laundry away. Washing the clothes will fall to the next boy in line when the chores switch and when he is remembering to do it regularly (it’s on a chart taped to the fridge). I see this as a life skill more than just a chore and I feel zero concern about this one being too much to ask. \n",
      "\n",
      "He never makes entire meals, but all three of the boys frequently help the girls (4 and 6) with snacks or sandwiches or a glass of milk, and I ask at least one of them daily to do a cooking task, like toasting a pan full of bread or flipping the pancakes or watching the oatmeal or breaking up and cooking ground beef. I feel these are important life skills and actually feel guilty for not teaching them more in the kitchen. \n",
      "I have occasionally (once a week or less) asked J to be in charge and keep the others as quiet as possible when I need a nap. My part time job has me up from 3:30 am 4-5 mornings a week, so I often don’t get enough sleep. \n",
      "I often allow the boys-3 of them share a room- to block their door so they can play with Legos etc without Godzilla baby barging in to joyfully destroy everything. \n",
      "I know he’s capable of much more than I ask, but I never want to cross the line into making him look back on growing up with resentment or feeling like I dumped my own responsibilities on him. \n",
      "I ask things of the others too, but it seems that he is the one I turn to the most because he’s the most capable and trustworthy. \n",

When she brought that up my husband told her: \"I see what you are doing here, you are bringing that up to hurt mami, she already apologized to you. You can trick her with this but you are not tricking me\" basically accusing her of trying to gilt tripping me. I think she was genuinely having a hard time and brought up things that still hurt her, in this case something i did to her but never to her sisters. I was really hurt by the way he talked to her and what he said to a 12yo having a hard time.

So far the most successful is getting her into her room, rocking her in the rocking chair for a little while and then getting her into bed.

I don't know how else to get her to hear me so that I can explain to her what is happening. I do explain before it gets to this point, I give her heads up that its almost time for bed, and before we go upstairs I talk her through the process. She knows the routine.

      "TLDR: The last 2 school years have been tough. Daughter has always made friends easily and now she's having issues with nasty girls but also her own behavior issues (likes her own way, bossy). This is coupled with an insane teacher last year along with bullying (screaming at kids, possible drug issue) and an nicer teacher this year but that doesn't seemingly like her (labelling her (Bossy, dark, etc) and playing favorites with less outspoken girls). I know I can't do much  about the teachers but how do I help my daughter cope with frenemies, being labelled by adults and teachers that don't care for her personality much? I understand this is part of life and we might as well get some coping mechanisms in place. TIA.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry, Long. Daughter is 9, just finished 3^(rd) grade. This year has been tough on the friends front, which is new. She’s bubbly, outgoing, never met a stranger, or had issues making friends until this year. Kindy and 1^(st) grade were awesome, even 2^(nd) was ok friendship wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "This post is actually 2 parts, but they sort of intertwine.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, last year, 2^(nd) grade was a nightmare. I saw this first hand when volunteering, and also spoke w 3 other moms who had kids going home saying verbatim what my daughter was. Unfortunately it was a chaotic classroom with a teacher not doing well. There was 1 severe behavioral issue (screaming meltdowns, hitting, throwing chairs) to the point where the other kids had to evacuate the classroom to stay safe. Teacher wasn’t getting enough support, but would also yell and berate kids, tell the kids she had “family issues”, was just loud and crass. Supposedly had a drug problem (painkiller use, this was confirmed off the record by another staff member/mom, and her spacey behavior backed it up). So, as a result, my daughter started telling ppl she was a “rabbit”, I think as a coping mechanism bc she didn’t feel safe (rabbits can be sneaky and hide easily). Husband and I let it go/downplayed it.  She got along with the other girls, had lots of friends but unfortunately she was bullied her toward the end of the year, called a furry/teased her about the rabbit thing but also attacked her appearance.  I got w the admin & got it resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, much apprehension going into next schoolyear. We meet the teacher, things seem great. Kid loves the teacher. She’s softer spoken, holds good boundaries and is nice to the kids. However, little things throughout the year started to pile on for me. First, daughter falls out with her bestie from the previous year.  Kid is not in her class and is kind of a mess so I’m not super disappointed. Parents are divorcing, so kid is acting out, starts bossing my daughter and even physically pushing her, telling her what to do. Daughter is over it, we talk about making new friends. She does! I’m Proud of her! She distances herself from the girl, it’s all good, she makes 2 new friends in class. Fast forward to spring, and her new bestie comes to her birthday party, it goes great. 2 days later at school they have a falling out. Bestie tells her she doesn’t want to be her friend, she’s done. IDK what really happened.  I encourage apologies and when the other girl isn’t having it, tell daughter she has to respect that and move on. She does! Starts making new friends. The former bestie is not happy with this either. “YOU stole all my friends (Trying to get a mutual friend to pick sides)”.  “YOU don’t seem too unhappy we’re not friends anymore!” “I’ll reconsider being friends with you if you change x and y about yourself”.  (On a side note, this kids mom is a teacher at the school as well as the girl from previous year. Honestly these kids of staff members strike me as feeling “untouchable” with their behavior, and I also wonder how much the staff talks amongst themselves esp when their kids are having conflicts w other kids, labelling kids?). Anyway, At this point Daughter starts Jumping around and tries on new friends, but ultimately nothing really sticks. She just doesn’t completely click with any of the girls in her class. She ends the year sad she doesn’t have a bestie and didn’t have many people to play with at recess. Seems to me to have more acquaitances than anything. A huge issue was her classmates calling her \"bossy\" and piling on. I think she's argumentative and likes to be right. But I have a hard time buying that all of these other kids are angels who do no wrong. I think they're all in a power struggle w each other, getting their way, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, This is where the teacher comes in. We met w her for a conference in the fall, she mentioned my daughter being “bossy”. She also said she was initially worried about the “rabbit thing” but it’s worked itself out because teacher had told her “No” about being a rabbit early in the year. That’s fine. Academically doing great. Thought the rabbit comment was a bit out of pocket, but whatever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next daughter melts down in the morning, goes to school crying. I feel bad and message teacher to make sure she’s ok. “She seems totally fine, but lets meet after class to strategize”.  OK. Meet after school and proceeds to give me parenting advice about how to have smooth mornings, set boundaries and make a “get ready for school chart” (I have one) “remember, you’re the parent!”. Things I already do. I am polite and exit the conversation. I feel she’s well meaning but again, it’s a bit odd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Year seems to go OK aside from the 2 friend meltdowns. Have spring conference. Academically great. Asked her socially how it’s going, mentioned her falling out with her friend recently after the bday party, and ask if she has any insight. Tells us “Well, honestly I didn’t’ see that friendship lasting long term anyway”.  This honestly offended me and seemed out of pocket.  I wish I’d of asked her to explain herself. She then told us our kid is bossy and likes to get her way and that “she had a kid who struggled socially making friends too”, so she knows it’s “hard”. Thing is, my kid has never had an issue before this year! That is what I struggle with. My kid has mentioned to me she's often called bossy by classmates too. She admits trying to be \"tough\" this year so she doesn't get bullied again, so I know this isn't working either for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left that conference feeling like a failure as a parent. Then, to make it worse, my daughter comes home 2 wks later telling me her teacher is “matchmaking” friends, i.e. telling 2 girls that they are a good match and should be friends. Of course, there is no match for my daughter, so she’s feeling bad about herself. At this point I’m realizing this teacher likes the quiet, nice girls who keep their feelings to themselves. Well, this isn’t my kid. I get that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there’s the writing assignment. My daughter rewrote a fairy tale, but didn’t give it happy ending. The characters were eaten by wolves at the end. The teacher called her “dark” and made her rewrite it. I honestly think my daughter thought it’d be funny. Plus she said “It’s reality mom! Not every story is going to have a happy ending! Think of the food chain!” I mean, she’s not wrong!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then came the end of year presentation. Only a handful of kids chose to do the harder powerpoint. Other kids did posters. My daughter was first to present her PPT. She did it completely independently of any help. She went, it was fine. Then a few presentations later, another girl went and the teacher praised her, told her she did a “great job because she used lots of adjectives and didn‘t just ‘list’ her points”. My kid takes it as a criticism of her ppt, as they were the only 2 ppts presented that day. She was crying when I picked her up, teacher said she didn’t know why, but to let her  know  if I figured it out. I got it out of her at home, and I did let teacher know  via an email why her feelings were hurt. She was defensive and denied any comparisons, but to her credit she did pull daughter aside and apologized for hurting her feelings.\n",

It’s like him pushing against me helps to wear him out. I know physical restraint probably isn’t the best but I’ve tried leaving the room but he will either just get out of bed and start playing or scream and cry. Sometimes I will encourage him to do physical activities like push his feet into my hands or even kick his legs on a pillow and that seems to help… but for whatever reason he is way worse with his dad. Is just crazy because he use to be the sweetest… no problems, but then we had to take his binky away and these behaviors emerged… we have a bedtime routine of reading books which usually goes well, but once it’s lights out he acts up.

Most of the time his worst days are when he doesn’t get enough sleep. He has a hard time falling asleep sometimes no matter how tired he is. He did pretty good in pre-k but his teachers said he would have to be moved during circle time sometimes bc he wouldn’t stop talking, wouldn’t share, etc. He can also be mean to my 3 YO a lot too. I’m nervous to send him to kindergarten because of these things. Getting him ready to go anywhere is a challenge.

Up until now, I've been okay with it, thinking it would take him some time. He was an early sitter, so we started him on solids at 5 months. He's now almost 13 months, and still a pain to eat anything. He's so picky, and usually most of the food I cook still goes to the floor. I've tried different spices, different cooking methods, fun shapes, and even hiding veggies and fruit in his food. He can still taste it, and will either spit it out or - you guessed it - throw it on the floor.\n",

He already doesn't eat much, and I hear from so many parents and pediatricians that once babies hit 18 months old they slow down their eating because they simply don't need as many calories anymore. I fall into despair just thinking about him eating less than what he currently eats now. \n",

The only thing he (fairly) consistently will eat is fruit. Sometimes bread. Sometimes cheese. He doesn’t touch meat. Doesn’t typically go for the frozen veggie nuggets made for toddlers. Quesadillas are a maybe. Pasta is usually a no. Veggies are actually a few bites so that’s nice.\n",

If I walk into the kitchen, he follows me whining. I open the fridge, and he’s climbing on it, grabbing things if he can, and then I give him that thing, and he doesn’t eat it. Playing this game sounds fine but the whining takes its toll. I can’t actually make or heat him up food without whining the whole time. So I certainly am not doing anything for myself. The whining will happen if he’s just by himself, if I’m holding him, if he’s in the toddler tower. It doesn’t matter.

      "Short story long, he was a NICU baby for meconium aspiration syndrome, which I feel like contributes to some of the issues - primarily feeding. I breastfed him as a baby but worked part time so he'd also take expressed milk via bottles, but at 8 months went on a bottle strike and would only nurse, which was fine until I was in the hospital for a week with gallstone complications and he ended up in the ER for dehydration. He wanted to walk at 6 months old and didn't bother trying to crawl til 8 months. He had 1 word at 12 months, and at 18 months was the same. He had speech therapy for a year. He's extremely stubborn. If he doesn't want to do something he's asked of he won't. Even if the end result is something he'd like - in speech, therapist tried to get him to sign \"mine\" for his toy. He spent 45 minutes refusing. Also around 18 months he started eliminating foods he was willing to eat and not replacing them, cue feeding therapy. He does talk now and still in OT partially for feeding concerns. He has also always been a terrible sleeper. He couldn't go to sleep independently until he was close to 2, and that even was short lived. He listens to music all night - for the past year it was Braham's lullaby on repeat for 12 hours. Now it's Laurie Berkner food songs playlist. He loses his mind if I put anything else on. He has always been 0 or 100. He has no middle ground. He's either super happy and excited or having an absolute meltdown. Transitions are hard, even getting dressed in the morning. It isn't a clothing issue, but a stopping and doing something else issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up at OT through a developmental ped evaluation, which we were referred to from the feeding clinic. We were given an autism eval and he didn't meet criteria, and the BASC which was elevated for possibly ADHD, but at 2.5 I'm not sure how accurate that screener would be. The evaluation gave vague diagnosis of unspecified impulse disorder (again, 2.5 years old), feeding difficulties, and a placeholder of Unspecified disorder of psychological development. I brought up sensory processing disorder and they said maybe, do an OT eval. The OT eval also was kind of vague. He's a tough cookie to nail down, he doesn't fall squarely in any one category or meet all the criteria for anything. He scored high in both sensory seeking and sensory avoiding.\n",

It breaks our hearts to see him struggle and cry so much, and it is exhausting for all of us. We started to doubt all the literature on baby sleep. They all say that making a routine helps the baby, but for us, it feels like the routine actually makes him more irritable. When the baby notices it is bedtime, he starts to resist. When things get very difficult, we try new things — and sometimes they work (for instance, trying to put him to sleep in the living room). Please, please, please do not reply with “It is normal for this age.” If things were supposed to be this difficult, I have no doubt the human race would have gone extinct by now.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only way we could make her nap was by either rocking for a long amount of time (15-20 minutes), which could be tiring, or using the carrier and shushing, which would usually work within the first 10 minutes.\n",

      "At bedtime, the only thing that consistently works is feeding her right before sleep, which allow us to transfer her to the crib while she's already asleep.\n",

We are currently using the Angel seat and he keeps trying to sit up all the way, so we ordered an upright seat that has suction cups on the bottom cause the tub is kind of hard when you sit in it. The problem we came to realize is that our bathtubs have a “non slip” surface. The bottom of the tub has a texture to it that is preventing any kind of suction cups to stick (I also bought a mat to see if that gave the tub any cushion).

      "So we have a family member with an above ground pool and my mom asks to take my girls over there to swim every now and then. My girls are 3 yo and 8yo. Well my kids came back from swimming one day and my 8 yo said she got scared because she slipped out of the floaty (she can't swim yet) and almost couldn't get back up but her cousin (10yo girl) helped her get to the side of the pool because grandma was out in the yard, sitting in the car on her phone. She literally had my 3 year old out there with a ring floaty and arm floaties and left her to swim in it on her own. SHE almost went under as well. (I wasn't there obviously) But the audacity of my mother to leave these babies to swim on their own with no one but a 10 yo child watching them...tf is wrong with her?? Anyway, after my 7 yo told me all of this, I had a talk with my mother and told her that it's NOT ok and that if she wasn't going to be in the pool with them then i didn't want them in it either. She said ok and she understood but then did the same thing a few weeks later and told my kids not to tell me. I only know this because my 7 yo told me anyway. She said she told grandma that mom wasn't ok with them swimming alone when she noticed my mother start to walk away from the pool (because she doesn't like it either, she gets scared with no one there) and my mom told her it wasn't going to hurt anything and that I could get over it....then said but \"don't tell mom\". At this point I don't feel comfortable letting her take them to the pool anymore. How would you handle this? And if she can't be trusted with them at the pool, could i even trust her with them at all?? Sadly, she was the ONLY person i thought that I could trust my kids with and now it seems that I can't trust anyone with them at all. She is going to be angry, but my kids safety comes first. Am I crazy for being mad about this?? I don't think so....but HOW does she not see how dangerous this is??!?! How do I explain this to her to where she gets it through her head?? It's so infuriating because I don't play about my kids lives being at risk!!\n",

      "Post 131: Desperately need to vent, I’m about to blow with stress. (NO ADVICE NEEDED)\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no idea where to even begin. This is gonna be a LONG post so bear with me. When my son was born until he turned 6m, I would SWEAR I got insanely lucky with such a mild tempered baby. He basically never cried unless hungry, or poopy. Even if his diaper was wet, he’d never cry. He was, and is, the perfect baby. At 6m, his development started slipping and we got referred to ped urology and learned he needs an orchiopexy. At 6m, once his development started falling off, I self referred him to early childhood intervention. At the assessment, we learned he was 2m behind. Fast forward some, 10m old, he starts showing signs of ASD (Hubby is diagnosed) so we started tracking symptoms and ages they started. The last 7 days have been actual hell. Saturday, the 26th, we had his first birthday party. I was so stressed and tense the whole time I couldn’t even enjoy myself. He’s been teething like crazy so he was not super happy either. We had a scare at the party when my aunt decided to force him to eat frosting from his cake… and he started gagging so bad his lips went blue. Everything was fine since then till Wednesday this week (30th). He had his 12m ped appt where his development is now all REALLY bad, he got referrals I requested, and some concerns were raised. Yesterday (31st), I started my monthly, we needed another Dr appt due to an inaccurate head measurement. Today (1st) we went BACK into the doctor because my son had signs of an eye infection. One of the staff members was incredibly rude and condescending to me, and even MORE concerns were raised. Before I spill everything that happened in the last 3 days… lemme also say, in the last year, my son has been to the ER more than he’s been to the pediatrician. All for a variety of reasons… car accident, BRUE episodes, difficulty breathing, potential seizure, etc. Back to today, I learned my son needs to see neurology, get evaluated by a child development/rehab center for both ASD and difficulty eating table foods, he needs a good amount of blood work next week, plus monitoring for potential circulation issues. I’m exhausted and drained. Every other week, another medical issue pops up it seems. He needs more intensive development therapy, surgery, and all these evaluations by specialists. I feel like I cannot win. I want nothing more than to have a boring life at this point. Keep in mind, all these specialists that he needs to see… are a MINIMUM 3.5hr drive from us. It feels like everything spiraled starting at 6m and I cannot keep up. I’ll also add, the ASD assessment, I got a referral for my son at his 12m appt because the wait is like… NO less than a year out. I have a history of stress related seizures and all day today I’ve had aura for them again due to how much seems to be going wrong in life. Idk what to do. I don’t really have anywhere to vent atm so here I am lol. Thank you if you read all of this. I just needed to get it out.\n",

We have never worn shoes in the house, and do not use scented anything anymore. We keep exposure to germs minimum. Right before turning one, she scratched her neck til it bled after eating eggs (we also have an allergist appointment on the 6th) this prompted a ER visit.

He recommended beetle juice, I asked is it painful or would it cause scaring, he said no. I agreed to the treatment and my daughter reacted very negatively to them applying it.

We went inside and I repeated: you can’t go help daddy when you’re naked, let’s go put clothes on! He sort of made some moves towards his room but kept getting distracted by various things - I’m thirsty, I want a snack, let’s play hot wheels - on and on, while still in between play asking to go help daddy. “Yes, great idea!

Today when he came home I got him to help me fix himself a snack, I asked him to help me wash the melon which I put in a bowl with water, he'll usually sensibly wash the fruit and do as I show him, however this time he just splashed the water everywhere and laughed. I told him that's not how we clean the fruit and and he just started telling and jumping on the tower. As I cleaned up I saw that he pushed his dad and kept doing it as if to see what we would do, like it was something new he learned. He was also quite emotionally volatile upon coming home today, he tried to balance some blocks but they kept falling so he cried, in another instance he nearly slipped off the learning tower (but didn't) and that caused him to go from laughing to crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "My worry as a parent who knows my child is that there is something happening at nursery upsetting/distressing my son that he cannot communicate (he can speak some words but not fluently, and I can't figure out how to teach him to talk about his wellbeing and safety and to tell me if something is wrong because it seems like he won't understand). I think this is the case because this is how he acts when something is distressing him that he can't communicate with words, he'll just misbehave and test our limits. Or if he has learned something new he will practice this new behavior at home. I noticed now thinking about it that he has also started to pinch me and look at me to see a reaction and repeatedly do the behavior as if he's practicing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am heartbroken at the thought of my baby suffering in silence, I am worried that if I bring this to the nursery they'll say he's fine. I ask them nearly every day how he's getting on and they always deny there is anything to worry about, but I don't have any proof that anything is going on other than my mother's instinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "What can I do in this situation? Should I pull him out of nursery? The problem with that is that it's just me and his dad we don't have much of a community or village, all his cousins are a city away, it's literally just the 3 of us day in and out, and it's important to me that he gets peer exposure and isn't just sitting here bored with us. I'm also at uni trying to become a nurse so I am always tired and have no energy but I try to muster it in the evenings and weekends for him. I also want him to have social contact often and to grow and learn how to deal with people who are unkind, so that brings me to the next point.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I teach my 2 year old how to enforce boundaries with his peers and to tell an adult when he is uncomfortable or hurt? At the moment he is babbling and saying some words but he doesn't yet understand the concept of \"me\" and \"you\" or should I say the concept of himself, which I'm working on as per nurses instructions. If I ask him what him name is he won't understand, he also doesn't understand when I ask him how nursery has been today or how his day has been today. But he is absolutely great in other areas he can count to 10,knows the names of his favourite characters and shows, and loves singing his favourite songs word for word. \n",

      "\n",
      "England, UK. \n",
      "My son is 9 and is the most amazing kid you can imagine. He works hard at school and he is mostly super well behaved. I’ve very rarely had to tell him off. I am a strict parent in terms of boundaries and rules but also fair in that some things are negotiable (like if he wins an award at school he can have an extra fizzy pop that week to celebrate). He has his off days but ultimately he is just the best thing I could have ever hoped for. I’ve never smacked him and only been fuming mad with him once when he injured an animal and even then I sat him safely in a chair until I could calm down, check on the animal and talk him through why it was wrong and how he needed to apologise and never injure another living thing ever again. It worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I’ve been noticing recently how his behaviour is very anxiety lead. If that’s even a thing. He just seems like he is on egg shells sometimes and he has started having issues at school, especially with his teacher.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I gave birth to him it felt like the stars aligned for me, but within a few months I had slipped into ppd. I sought counselling (cbt) and in the end went on to medication (he was 1yo at this point). I started getting a handle on myself with the medication and a change in job where I was confident and well respected. I was making loads of progress and could see life was getting better. Then I was drugged and SA’d on a charity trip (son was almost 3 at this point-he wasn’t with me when this happened). \n",
      "\n",
      "Then in 2019 I was diagnosed with ASD and an ADHD diagnosis came in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s where stuff gets hazy. My brain literally blocked the SA out for 6 years. But for that 6 years my mental health tanked faster and faster each day. I ate and ate and ate, I was angry and resentful all the time. I was horrible to be around. I lost my job. I lost my mind. Then i started taking Mounjaro which stopped my excessive eating but then I couldn’t bury the SA which was starting to come forward in my memory. \n",
      "\n",
      "In September last year (son was 8) I went to the police and reported what happened so I could start to move forward. I’m on the wait list for therapy. I told my husband and manager at my new job and I’ve been put back on medication for depression and anxiety. \n",
      "\n",
      "But now I look at my son and I can see the damage I’ve caused in the six years of crazy. He is anxious and frustrated, he still wets the bed (I always thought this was a family failing as I also wet the bed until I was 10) but stuff at school seems to continue to spiral out of hand for him. He can’t cope when the teacher raises her voice. He panics if he hears people shouting. He got upset the other week when my neighbours were shouting on the street at each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think I’m sharing this with internet strangers because I’m desperate to know what to do. Do I find him counselling? Do I tell the school that stuff has been difficult for him at home because of me or will the safeguard him? Am I truly a terrible parent? I only have my own upbringing to compare to and I strive every day to do better than my parents did. But it’s not been enough. Am I just overreacting because I’m hormonal and stressed? Is there anything I can do to reassure him that he is safe and loved? I tell him I love him every single day, multiple times. I also tell him how proud of him I am and how I see that he always tries his best.\n",

      "The other day I lost my temper and screamed at the dog (the dog didn’t want but husband got anyway). My son came in and hugged me and crying, told me he just wants me to be happy.

      "\n",
      "My 6 yo has ADHD & SPD. He’s kinda shy, has some hyperactivity, but never gets sent to the office, we don’t have behavioral issues or anything. He does have a 504 plan & IEP for his SPD, sometimes smells in the cafeteria, will make him physically sick so he does have special allowances for that, but all in all he is always done fairly decent in school and was always excited to go… up until around Christmas. I’m just mentioning his background bc I want people to understand the type of kid he is, I understand that some kids with ADHD are a handful, and trust me, mine definitely is, but School is something that never really gave us too much of a problem before now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, fast-forward to Christmas and all of a sudden he starts saying he doesn’t wanna go to school. Which is so strange because he’s usually lining up at the door ready for me to drive him. Over the next few weeks he suddenly get stomach aches and wants to stay home, his dad and I are not together, and he keeps trying to “go to work with Dad”, I’ve had to explain to them so many times like school is not optional. I’ve point-blank asked him. Is somebody being mean to you? Is there a reason why you don’t want go to school? I also want to add, I have always struggled with communication with him. He will talk about what he’s doing at that second, but not the future or the past unless it’s asking for a toy for Christmas lol, idk if that’s normal, but he would *not* talk about it, bribes, nothing worked. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Valentine’s Day cards came out, he got all excited because he got a card from “his bully“ like what do you mean “your” Bully? Like kids aren’t supposed to have bullies?? I kept asking him questions about it, and he just would not tell me he would say “he didn’t remember” but it got to the point that when I’m picking him up for school he’s coming out crying. I asked the teacher and she said it’s because of a disagreement about who is first in line which my son vehemently denies. But yet he won’t tell me what really made him cry, and it’s happened 3 times in the past month. I’ve had to physically drag him out of the car and carry him into the school. The principal will let him sit in a chair near his office for a little bit until he feels comfortable go to class, but they keep denying that there’s a problem. I have emailed the teacher multiple multiple times, I have spoken to the principal face-to-face on at least half a dozen occasions, and each time they say it has nothing to do with bullying. Well, I get a call that my son got *head butted* in the hallway and that one of his front tooth might be loose. I pretty much lost it. And I told the principal that I was not bringing him back until I felt like my son was safe. This was right before April vacation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a meeting with his principal when we came back from break, and it’s just I feel like I’m talking to a brick wall. The man denies that there’s anything to do with bullying or anything like that. And I keep saying he was head butted! They wrote that off as “horse play in the hallways“ he’s crying when I’m picking him up, that’s wrote off as him learning that he might be able to stay home if he throws a fit, and I’ll admit, I gave that some thought. I do know he’s at the age where he testing his limits, but we are not a conversation that broke my fucking heart. I bought these conversation starter cards, and it actually worked! At first we started talking about if he could have one superpower or what would it be, and then I slipped in “how does it make you feel when people say mean stuff to you at school” He said that “everybody in his class hates him“ and that he feels like he wants to “kick the door down and jump out the window” when people say mean stuff to him, so I clarified, did that mean he just wanted to get away? or did it make him angry? And he said both. He said he wants to do homeschool. **My 6yo brought up homeschool**. I am also going through a lot with losing my little business due to the tariffs, and I will admit that I’m overwhelmed, I definitely i’m up to my eyeballs as a single mother of 2 & 6 yo boys with zero help.. \n",

      "So what would you do? If it was your child? Because I have gone to the school, I have gone to his teacher. I have gone to the principal and I keep getting told that I’m wrong, and that has nothing to do with bullying and that all the kids seem to play with each other… am I overreacting? For debating pulling him out of school? I’m also running for office and I can’t imagine how I’m gonna do all of this by myself if I need to start homeschooling, but his mental health is the most important thing to me. I was bullied in school and it was hell, I never want my child to feel like what I felt, but I also don’t wanna project.\n",

      "I shower my two older boys (4 yo and the 3 yo) where I sit outside the shower. They are actually great at listening and swapping positions when I need them to, so I can wash their hair etc. The problem comes getting out of the shower. One the 3yo is finally out of the shower (a battle also), he just won't stand up. He makes his legs go like jelly and I have to hold him up. He actively tries to make his head and body touch as much of the floor as possible. I get frustrated because I can't dry him properly and the bathroom floor isn't always clean so he ends up with hair and dust fluff on him right after the shower. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also tries to run away while completely wet (slipping hazard) and I have to grab him to stop him from running away. The whole time I'm asking him to \"stop that, stand up, I need to dry you, please stand up, if I let go of you, you will fall etc etc\" but it's like talking to a black hole. He's having the time of his life, he's not upset, it's all a fun game to him, so I'm at a loss as to how to get him to listen so he just lets me dry him and he doesn't fall over and I don't have to lose my goddamn mind.

He won’t wash his hair or take a shower for months.

      "In the past, that worked well. In middle school and elementary, if his grade slipped, we take away his gaming laptop and phone. Until the new grades post, which means  he gets that stuff taken away for 3 months until the next posted report card following the next semester. This has worked well in the past. The actions then were decisive and effective.   \n",
      "  \n",
      "Now, none of that matters. He is 16 and has his own money. Taking away his car, phone, gaming computer, he can just go out and buy and replace them. Take away his phone data plan? No problem, he is at age where can buy his own sim card, his own phone and off he goes. If you read the other reddit posts on how kids and parents interact with money, our belief is if it is his money, we have no say in it. We can only teach him responsibility and personal finance. What he does with his own money is his own thing. And taking away those thing aren't really practical. Take away his car, he is happy he doesn't have to drive his siblings to school. And instead of driving to the gymn, he will gladly spend 6 hours lifting weights at home.

We tell him, in the \"real world\" once he gets a real job, turning in late projects doesn't gets a free pass. Same in college. He can sweet talk a high school teacher, doesn't mean he can pull the same stunt in college.  \n",

I’ve slipped on the boundary I originally put in place and allowed occasional posting to show being a proud grandparent etc, but it’s getting out of hand now to the point where we are uncomfortable. I hate social media but feel the need to have it since it is how I find out about my community events for my children. \n",

Usually good about asking, occasionally slips up and will tell me after, or say “oh you’re going to be so mad but I had to post this” (like posting a video of my kid in a group with hundreds of thousands of people… you couldn’t see much of my kid and it wasn’t embarrassing or anything, mostly my kid talking) frustrating. \n",

I sent parent texts about how frustrated I was and even a link to arrest records for this person later in life (this is wildly embarrassing - this person has spiraled.) It is concerning because I feel like if they were to ever crack, they now have this personal information about me and where I’m healthily raising my family. It is thousands of miles away, but still. I’m upset. \n",

Should I transition her to a sleep sack so she slips less?  She can grab pacifiers with her hands in the Zipadee Zip so maybe she was overtired (it was an hour past her bedtime) which made her so clumsy.

We really enjoy our quieter time with our LO. I'm due to return to work at the end of this month after maternity leave and I was looking forward to getting back to normal. Childcare was sorted in a way that wouldn't financially destroy us (a mixture of nursery and WFH with the support of family). For the first time in my life, I've actually picked up some hobbies. I'm getting to the gym and I've just started netball which I LOVE. LO is sleeping mostly through the night. My husband and I have a great balance. Life is pretty great. \n",

      "The main reason I wanted another was so my LO would have a 'full time' sibling. He loves the older two, but I know realistically there's so much they'll miss out on together. I wanted to wait a few months before making a decision, but one night we weren't as careful as we should've been and that one slip up has resulted in a pregnancy. Prior to the positive test, I'd already decided I didn't want another. \n",

      "It's a now or never situation as my husband was only open to another on the basis it happened within the next year. Financially, we can support another but it would mean going from comfortable to stretched. It means a bigger home and a bigger car. It means I can't continue my childcare arrangements with family long term when I return to work a second time, so it's likely higher nursery fees for not one, but two children. I'll get a year off for maternity, but being a full time SAHM isn't an option until we buy our next home because we need my income in order for the lender to approve us. It means taking a pause on my fitness and netball, which was really great for me mentally. \n",

I’m doing this whole mom thing pretty much 100% on my own, I’m staying home with my daughter while my husband works 8-6 five days a week, and while I’m very thankful for his contributions  for our family, he seems to think that he doesn’t have to be an involved parent because of this. \n",

Between all this, I have basically no time to myself. It’s hard to keep on top of cleaning when baby is fussy most of the day and freaks out when I leave her sight, so there’s always a few dishes in the sink, clutter on the counter tops, and laundry that needs to be put away. I try my best but it’s never going to be spotless, and apparently never going to be good enough for my husband as he always makes comments about the mess.

The topic is like beating a dead horse, I’ve told him so many times I need help, I want him home more, but he says it’s boring at home, he doesn’t want to be there, and looking after baby isn’t that hard. I find that so ironic because he can barely hold her for five minutes before getting frustrated and handing her back to me, so I know for sure he could not survive even one day in my shoes. \n",

Every time I see her I’m flooded with passive aggressive comments about how everything I’m doing isn’t right, how she was basically super mom, etc. I don’t get along with her for many reasons, in short she is just not a nice person, and I don’t want her around myself or my daughter. Aside from that, she also feels like the third person in our relationship. She phones my husband every single day, basically demanding he help her with chores on her farm. Along with not being nice, she’s also very lazy and would prefer my husband do 90% of her workload as well as his full time job. She’s perfectly able bodied by the way, she’d just rather sit on the phone or watch tv while my husband does her dirty work. \n",

She could not give a flying shit about the fact I’m struggling and need help, last Sunday morning I had finally got my husband to agree to watch baby for a while in the morning while I catch up on some rest, she phoned him demanding he come help her, he actually said no for once and that he was watching baby for me, and she did her usual routine of hanging up on him and getting upset. So not only do I have a husband that doesn’t want to help me most of the time, I also have his mom that actively tries to stop him from being a more involved parent so she can get what she wants. \n",

      "Sorry this got so long but we had a sleepover this last weekend with my partner, Sean, his cousins, and their grandparents. Sean and I are the oldest at 26 and 27, our son is 13 months. His cousin Abby (21) was there with her son Charlie (2). \n",
      "\n",
      "Some backstory, Abby got pregnant at 19 with her then boyfriend (also 19). Her grandma is hispanic; so religious and staunchly anti-abortion. Abby was very close to her so she decided to keep the baby. I had met Charlie's father once, it was when we went to a buffet and he was glued to his phone the whole time watching gaming clips. Definitely not ready to be a father. He \"co-parented\" for a year before leaving. Her grandparents raised Charlie from the beginning. She lived with them the first year while she worked at her mom's restaurant. Abby's grandparents, mom, and sisters pretty much watched him full time. Because everyone was occupied with Charlie and I guess cus Sean and I were older, they didn't reach out as much when our son was born so we raised him without \"the village\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Their family believes Charlie had ADHD or is some type of neurotypical. Sean and I feel like he's a normal young boy with the energy to match. Their grandma, although cares a lot, is very strict with her parenting style and gives us a lot of outdated advice, the most egregious ones are feeding tips. \n",
      "\n",
      "From when Charlie started solids it was a constant struggle to get him to eat. His grandma would hold his head and force food in his mouth (something Sean is still traumatized about). When Charlie got bigger it was more difficult to hold him down so they would distract him with an iPad to sneak food in but he would still throw full blown tantrums. To supplement the lack of food they would give him a lot of liquids; formula, milk, juice. Every time we've visited she tries to force feed our son and when he didn't eat from her she'd tells us he must want milk, despite us telling her he had a bottle/eaten right before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cut to last weekend, the sleepover was the first time we had seen them in months. When we walked in Charlie was on his iPad and Abby was trying to get him to eat plain pasta. The rest of the food hadn't arrived yet so I fed a few pieces of pasta to my son which he happily munched on. Eventually I grabbed a big plate for myself and my son. I don't portion food out for him or give him baby meals, he eats what I eat. I take my time eating while I let him play and wait for him to circle back for a bite. Since there were so many people there he would stop by each person with a plate of food and open his mouth for them so I let him get fed from everyone else. Sean's grandma made a plate for Charlie and tried to chase him down to eat but he would scream every time she tried. When she managed to get food in his mouth, he'd immediately spit it out and run away. Even with the iPad, she only managed to give him a few bites. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her hold my son's head down once to feed him which he did NOT like. I think she got tired so she ended up sitting down with the plate. After watching my son calmly eat from other people she called him over and he would stop, open his mouth for food, and crawl away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The babies kept playing after dinner. My son was exploring and whenever he touched something we didn't want him to we would loudly say \"no\" and shake our head and he'd drop it and leave. Whenever Charlie would grab or do something they didn't want him to they'd put a different video on the iPad in hopes of distracting him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually it was bed time for both so Sean set up the bassinet for our son while Charlie went into their grandparents bed. I made a 6oz bottle for my son and he only drank 4oz because of how much he ate. Their grandma kept trying to push him to drink more but he'd toss the bottle to the side so I dumped the rest out when she wasn't looking and set him up for bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Breakfast pretty much went the same, my son ate a lot (beans, eggs, bread), Abby even fed him a bit while their grandma force fed Charlie some eggs. Every time he started to whine the iPad was promptly pulled out. My son eventually got whiny when we were pushing past his nap time. Their grandma tried to force feed him milk and he was not happy about that so he was extra irritated. We eventually decided to head back early to let him nap at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sean and I were talking about the sleepover and we were just mesmerized on how different the two boys are. Whenever we get unsolicited advice from his grandma we politely nod and end up doing the opposite. Sean has told me countless times of how she was the source of his anxiety and how he has a bad relationship with food because of her. I think she thinks we're failing as parents because our son is so skinny but he's just extremely active and smaller genetics-wise (also born at 37w). He also whines a lot with her which she doesn't like. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are very in tune with our son's wants and needs and we let him lead us. The sleepover just confirmed; even if we're doing it alone we're still doing it right. We are fully in control and no one can override our parenting. Our son listens to us, plays well, eats well, and is on track with his development. I used to envy Abby and all the help she had but now I honestly feel bad for her and Charlie. I feel like they're hindering his development and claiming it as Autism/ADHD. We will happily deal with the burn out if it means we get to parent our son the way WE want to and at this point the results speak for themselves.\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) do all babies eat SOOOO slow? both babies eat their bottles at the speed of snails and i have zero clue why. the boy eats slow because he likes to throws himself around, take it out his mouth and stare at it, hold the bottle, chunk it, etc. the 7 month old, however, takes ages to eat even though she just lays there…and eats. she doesn’t budge, but takes 1838 years every single time and omg, i have things to do! i cant stop the toddler from burning the house down if im feeding 6 ounces for 30 minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "(2) is it normal for a 7 month old to not be making any attempts at crawling? im not her parent, nor do i want to bring it up, but i am slightly worried. she just recently started sitting up without toppling over, so it just worries me. \n",
      "\n",
      "(3) do all toddlers go through 827 cups a day?! i swear i refill that kid’s cup 4 times a day bc she’ll just sit and drink and drink and drink.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) does anybody else have toddlers that dont really like eating meals, just snacking alllll day. she eats food, but she will only eat every 30 mins or so and a little bit at a time. \n",
      "\n",
      "(5) how in the world do you break toddlers off binkies? she is OBSESSED and if she doesnt have one, she will pitch a fit for hours and hours. her parents say night is the hardest, and i keep her for 12 hours during the day. \n",
      "edit to add: the parents are trying to break her from it, so its partially my responsibility to help also, i got the daytime part, so my job is easier LMAO. usually, she only wants one if she sees her baby sister with one. she stays pretty distracted and busy otherwise. i think i’m going to really lock in on distractions and gathering the collection of binkies around the house bc i swear, toddlers can ECHO LOCATE hidden binkies. remember that binkie that got lost inside the couch cushion 7 years ago? best believe a toddler weaning toddler will find it. \n",

      "Ok I’m coming to Reddit because I feel like someone has had to have dealt with this before & don’t really have anyone to relate to on this in my life. Anyways, I’ve been a SAHM for the past two years (that was my goal) she’s my only & we are attached at the hip. I started looking for a part time daycare 2 days a week about a year ago after I realized I was burning out (I’m a part time massage therapist as well working 3 days a week) well we finally found one after a horrible winter with me dealing with PMDD (finally diagnosed & healing) and she started last week! We talked it up a whole lot and she seemed excited though I’m sure she didn’t really know what it was just excited that we were excited lol. She’s very social & has great speech & almost fully potty trained I knew she was ready on that end. Last week seemed to be a success she went in willingly & was tired but happy coming home. \n",
      "Well, these past 2 morning drop offs have been BAD. She’s welling up in the house putting her shoes on, hugging me so much, saying “we’re home” over and over. But I convince her & we get there & same thing as the previous day death grip hold, had to peel her off of me, reassuring her how much fun she’ll have & that “mommy always comes back” but she’s just scream crying & it truly breaks my heart. shattered. To a billion little pieces. I get in the car & cry, come home still crying writing this. They try to make the drop offs short as to not prolong the crying but FUCK. My mom heart is not made for this. My point being: does it get any easier!? She’s only there Thursdays & Fridays so I know there will be an adjustment period but am I a horrible person for leaving her? Should I take her out!? 😩 I just feel like the biggest asshole. I feel like I should’ve done this sooner to make it less hard on her. Yes leaving your newborn at 4 months with daycare SUCKS, America needs longer maternity leave but my poor girl was so used to just her & I. Someone just please assure me that I’m doing the right thing. I’m spiraling lol. Thanks in advance. \n",

      "Since the beginning of my pregnancy I’ve been told I will be needing an induction and for months I have firmly said no and was met with relentless resistance and pressure to schedule one anyway. “She may be big and shoulder dystocia” but I read that inductions can cause an increased risk of shoulder dystocia, further medical intervention such as epidural for pain or c section all together should my body react poorly to the synthetic hormone, or worse of all fetal distress because it’s synthetic and unnecessary in many cases. So I’d rather take the chance and trust my body to do what it’s supposed to do and be a safe place for my baby until she is ready to come on her own. My sister in law had her baby 2 weeks early because her baby was “huge” and the drs she had convinced her she needed an induction and she was born too small for newborn clothes which they had already gotten rid of at the advice of the drs. \n",
      "I know she could be “big” but she could also not be and her heart rate looks great and she moves great and she looks great according to every test or NST ran so why can’t I just let it be and allow myself to have this journey in trust and peace \n",

I read to make sure that you go within a certain time frame and especially if contractions havent started regularly and I wasn’t having regular contractions, more so period cramps. We did some walking and packed our bags in the car and went to the hospital attached to where I’ve gone for all of my prenatal “care.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I have felt so betrayed every single time we went to an appointment at this prenatal office  nd every single time we went there was something to scare us about and “watch” despite the actual numbers and test/lab results being fine every time. I am a big girl and I am 28 and I know they expected to find something wrong with me but there wasn’t but they sure tried to dig something up and I was treated like a broken woman. I was made to feel so inadequate and insecure in my ability to grow our baby and be a healthy home until she is earth side. \n",
      "Cue the problems-\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a calcium deposit in our baby’s  heart and we needed to be seen by MFM and we had an ultrasound…we never heard about the spot again unless we begged to find out more about it and we spent WEEKS being TERRIFIED only to be told everything was normal when we tried to inquire about it throughout the next few weeks.  My blood pressure was high a couple times (only after talk of induction and being ignored when stated we believed in a natural and spontaneous labor) they would check my blood pressure after these conversations and they made me believe that was the end of the world and I was hurting our baby and I needed medicine so I started taking and logging my blood pressure at home to compare. The results I had were never looked at despite my pulling them out on several occasions to prove I am well. I was put on medication once daily. Then twice daily. Then three times daily. Increasing the dose by 100 mg each time despite having clear readings at home showing no indication of hypertension. Then it was my blood sugar and I “failed” the one hour by getting 135 and they said the blood sugar number to look for is 140 and under so I had to take the 3 hour one and despite scheduling that twice they couldn’t get my blood on two different occasions and gave up both times and I left looking like a band aided pin cushion- so I wore a continuous glucose monitor and I didn’t eat sugar as to the best of my ability and watched my carb intake. I completely changed my diet just in case. Then it was “we need to test you for preeclampsia because of all of your health issues” and that came back negative the urine tests and the blood tests and another one I can’t remember. Then without tellling me why (I was still under the impression it was for the calcium deposit found in our girl’s heart) I started seeing MFM on Mondays for reasons I still don’t know as when I asked one dr said it was because I am bigger and automatically high risk for that, one dr said it was for the calcium deposit, one dr said it was for previous hypertension and gestational diabetes that I was never diagnosed with, and one said it was because she was measuring above average percentile. Every single appointment I had -twice a week- for NST testing was spent trying to convince me that while I am fine and my numbers coincide with being healthy and our baby is healthy that can change and she could be stillborn and we don’t want that so you should go ahead and schedule an induction to reduce that risk. Each appointment a different dr. One of 3 drs who each never showed my best interest a moments thought. Despite my being there so often the GSB swab and the cervical check was never mentioned to me and the day my dr wanted to perform those I hadn’t shaved or showered as I assumed it would be a routine staring at the ceiling and listening to our girls heart beat- wrong. I started crying because I know he and I don’t get along the best and I don’t trust him and I am not comfortable with this man at all to do anything so invasive to me…he tells me I am too emotional and I need to get a handle on my emotions… I lay back and let him do the GSB swab and decline the cervix check. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we’ve caught up on my prenatal visits I’d like to talk about my hospital visit last night when I believed I was in stalled labor. We enter the hospital and I didn’t get to speak or explain what it is that was going on or any concerns my man and I had- at the desk I said “I am 39 weeks and 6 days, I believe my water broke but I am not having painful or intense contractions” and that was the last time I felt I had a voice. The nurse took us to a room and told me to change to a gown and hooked me up immediately to the continuous fetal monitoring machines, blood pressure cuff, and oxygen monitoring finger thing, and my temperature was taken. All fine and dandy except I am about ready to explain what’s going on but before I do she pulls up a chair at the foot of this hospital bed and immediately begins the pitocin talk. I said “I would like to avoid that. I am not okay with it unless it is ABSOLUTELY necessary.” To which I got the same response about stillbirth as our girl is kicking me in the ribs reminding me that she is okay. She continues to talk over me for about five minutes and stand up to tell me that I will need an amniotest and then we will know where we are as that’s the most important thing to find out right now and I am not to move until we know because of infections I/baby could get from walking and cord prolapse from walking. So I need this test quickly to know what is going on. Two and a half hours pass. I’ve laid like a bug under a microscope for over 3 hours now unable to move or sit up or look at my partner in the room with me. Just the bright ceiling light and the 7 dead bugs inside of it above my head. The nurse walks in with another nasty coughing fit and a large qtip she has hacked all over for a vaginal swab to see if my waters have broken… she warns me before she enters me and I am grateful, however, she missed. She jammed that huge qtip in my urethra and it felt like razors. I screamed and crawled away as fast as I could and sobbed at how painful it was. She said “op I didn’t mean to hurt ya” and tried again, successfully going in the correct hold this time only to say “there that wasn’t so bad huh.” I am still bleeding the next day and it burns every time I have to pee which is only [redacted-phone] times. She leaves with the test to get results in 30 minutes and soon the dr on call comes in to introduce herself. She is appalled I am still pregnant and I haven’t scheduled an induction and talks down to me in a way that I cannot describe especially being unable to sit up and look her square in the eye. I finally decided to get up anyways to look at the person speaking to me this way and the entire time I am aware my butt is hanging out of the back of this gown and I feel so vulnerable and weak and not empowered or strong. I want to sob. She tells me if I don’t start things on my own and very soon they will begin an iv and pitocin to induce me if my water has broken and leaves. I begin praying my water hasn’t broken…about an hour later I am told it didn’t break and honestly the rest is history. I signed an AMA and I left. I did. We have been looking for a new hospital to beg to take us or just wait for labor to begin naturally and go anywhere else. I am so tired of feeling so inadequate and broken and I am so tired of having people meant to support me talk down to me and scare me into compliance. \n",

Even trying to push myself to do chores I feel like I'm going to fall asleep standing up and doing tasks it's getting so bad.

      "Let me just preface this with logically, I realize I am spinning. Mentally, I need to fucking vent. I have a 1.5 year old. He used to sleep beautifully after sleep training. Now he wakes up practically on schedule every night at the same time and is awake for HOURS. Yes, I limit his naptime. Yes, I try to get him out of the house at least once a day. Yes, I have mom friends, I arrange \"playdates\" (for me basically) where I host and let the kids tear up the house, shit, I even throw great children's parties. He doesn't eat?! He demands fucking bananas and pouches all day long. The science based parenting reddit has posts that insinuate I'm a terrible mother for letting him suck down food. I didn't start using any until two months ago. I offer him new foods. He wants nana and POWch. \"No\" leads to meltdowns and refusals to eat. He wouldn't latch and wouldn't gain in the first month and I'm fucking traumatized from it and I just want him to eat \\*something\\*.  I really don't want to read another goddamn fucking book on parenting, sleep, or food. I don't want to follow another fucking social media account that has all the answers and \"worked like a dream\". I am so tired of researching parenting. Isn't anything natural supposed to kick in!? I set clear boundaries and use \"no\" when needed, I distract and redirect when possible (barring the food issue -- I need him to eat). His dad is a resident and works non-stop. We are a thousand miles away from family. I am in therapy. I am on medication. I feel like I am not even burnt out, I am fucking burning down. I want to soak it up. He's a wonderful child. He is beautiful and smart and has impeccable comedic timing. He prefers his father over me and I think literally always has. This too is slowly killing me. I hated the newborn phase. I had a brief love of the beginning of toddlerhood and now? Give me fucking shelter. I am so, so tired. I can't seem to get enough time to myself. When his dad is home I practically vanish, retreat and take every opportunity to get away and be by myself and do anything for myself. I feel selfish and crazy. I tried doing things that bring me joy while with my son once (embroidery) and he grabbed the fucking needle in my handle and stabbed himself in a flash. I have tried reading while encouraging independent play and he fusses and I'm sorry but I don't know how to read in like five minute increments. We cannot afford a daycare and that's a big part of why I'm a SAHM. Plus, I WANTED this. Please someone, anyone, relate to me. Tell me I'm not doing the worst job in the world at this. Or maybe tell me the truth that I'm afraid to hear, that I am a terrible mother. Every day I promise myself I'll do better the next day. I will be more regulated. More engaged. More connected. Put down my phone more. I can't seem to help it. I am starving for more adult interaction and I can't seem to get enough. All my life, I knew I wanted children. Now I feel like I am failing, I'm failing him and myself. \n",

I see a lot of kids his age when their parents say stuff like stay in the area or when they say no don’t touch, they actually listen. My son thinks everything is a game and just runs off, onto the street, jumps into water, touches hot things, dirty things. He can’t sit still ever. We’re quite firm when we tell him no and have only said no to dangerous things. But it’s not clicking. Like just this weekend he touched my hot straightener and burned his finger. After I told him don’t touch it because he kept reaching for it maybe 100 times. In a second he snatched it. The other day he refused to be held (he’s a big boy 99% percentile) refused to sit in his stroller, and refused to hold my hand so we were walking and I told him stay on the path or hold my hand. And he directly ran onto the street. I truly feel like a horrible mom but I’m exhausted physically and mentally at this point I’m like do I just let him get injured?  \n",

      "A little background: I have two tiny humans at home, ages 2 and 3.5, who recently started daycare and surprisingly haven’t staged a rebellion yet. I work full-time as a case aide for CPS in my local town and have been doing it for almost three years. The job is Monday through Friday with the occasional “surprise, you’re working late!” sprinkled in. I genuinely love helping families, but the drama with coworkers is next-level—like reality-TV level. I usually come home feeling like a balloon someone let the air out, and am burned out! \n",

Then, out of nowhere, I got a job offer from the local county jail (don’t worry, working there, not staying), and I loved the interview. The place felt right. The hours seemed more stable, the facility was updated in the last five years, and the people didn’t make me want to crawl into a hole. Plus—get this—a $3.50 raise, a strong union, and better benefits than the state. Somehow the county is winning that contest, don’t ask me how.\n",

Add in the fact that we live in the Midwest (read: Snowmageddon), and when it gets bad, my husband has to camp out at work like he’s on an involuntary boy scout trip. We don’t have much family support nearby either, so that’s a whole logistical Rubik’s Cube.\n",

      "After swimming for around 30 minutes, my daughter wanted to go play in the sand. I got out of the water with her while her dad and aunt kept swimming. We were walking back to our spot when she saw a shovel and sand toy she wanted, but I told her we had some toys in our bag and we can’t take other kids’ toys. Our bag was 5ish yards away so I kept walking to it to lay her life jacket out to dry, but she dug in next to the shovel. She was upset and saying “mommy come on, mommy come on!” wanting me to come back to grab the shovel.\n",

      "I stood my ground letting her know that we brought our own toys to try and teach her healthy boundaries. This stand off lasted for maybe 30 seconds. The next thing I knew a random woman stood up from her towel, jogged over to my toddler, picked her up and walked her over to me. I was stunned and ready to pounce, but part of me thought she was maybe trying to be helpful? When she sat her down she said “the sand is too hot for her, that’s what she’s saying.” I replied “she just wants that shovel”. She snapped back, “you can’t burn your kid’s feet, dude!” I just calmly said “she’s fine.” And she walked away. \n",

      "I just can’t get over how wild this whole exchange was. To pick up someone else’s kid is mind boggling to me! And there was not even a reason for it. My child wasn’t crying or screaming or saying she was hurt or too hot, just asking me to get a toy that was not hers. The sand was not too hot- I was standing in it as well and it was 5:30 pm in the Midwest, not like it was noon in Texas or something! We were also cooled off from the 30 mins in the water and it felt fine in the sand and the sun. My daughter and I proceeded to sit and play in the sand for the next 30 minutes and I so hope that woman saw how comfortable we both were in the sand. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were dozens of other kids playing in the sand as well. This woman didn’t have kids with her so maybe she is one of those people who thinks they know everything about being a good mom without experiencing motherhood themselves. I wish I would have gotten loud and told her not to touch my daughter in hindsight. I hate that this experience is over shadowing an otherwise super fun and sweet memory and, though we left happy, hydrated, and without sunburns, I still feel like I was judged as a bad mom. Idk- please tell me if I’m crazy for being disturbed by this interaction. \n",

We had a looooot of accident, full on neck to shoes, with no possibility to get her on the potty oder toilet. Complete refusal. Because school (start at 3 in France), we had to went back to pampers cos teacher hopeless and tired. Books and vids bout poopoo adventures in belly all depleted, no results. We went to shrink, told us to make a Pavlov dog out of her. So we did let the rewards rain, first peepee, the progressively all around poopoo. She nailed those until we came to the big deal. Only thing we got there is hysterical screams and accurate exorcist reenactment. Then she kept holding her poop, doing like tiny burned tired trace little by little, burning throu our diapers stocks. Also as soon as she felt the urge, she went all stiff, no touching allowed, hiding herself so that dialy activity program delayed till canceled. WE HAD ENOUGH. We told ourself (reasonably or not?) that back in the day our elders wouldn't negotiate with terrorists, it definitely did some trauma but I guess we survived. So we removed the diapers once and for all. She got quickly used to it again, not really asking for one. We expected a shitstorm, it didn't came. Instead we now have to use a battery of laxatives to empty belly every 5-7days with constant fear of bigger trouble. We now are at the point between constant propaganda 1984 style reminder / being nice a patient / shouting at each other and threatening / using the good ol Pavlov technic. Nothing work.

      "\n",
      "Sunday evening, my husband was out with our two kids (3.5 and 6) in the backyard. He started an impromptu fire in the fire pit with a metal cage that holds the wood in it. I don’t know exact details as I was inside cleaning/preparing for the kids’ bedtime. Somehow my 3yo reached out when he had the small door of the cage open to stoke the fire and grabbed it. It burned the bottom part of her index and middle fingers on her right hand. He had to scrub off black and such, but some remained on the skin. As I assessed it, I realized it was a second-degree burn and I wasn’t sure how to treat it especially for a 3 yo’s fingers. I placed clean gauze over it and called the after hours nurse line offered by her pediatrician. While I waited for a call back, I phoned the urgent care her pediatrician recommends, explained the situation, and asked if we could come in to get it treated. They consulted the doctor and told me they’d turn us away to go to the ER because there was some black remaining on her skin from the metal, which surprised me. The nurse called back and told me that she’d need to go into the ER. The following day was a holiday and so urgent care and ER was still the only choice. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband snapped and was very volatile about the situation. He said he was “furious” with me that I felt we should maybe listen to them and take her in. That if she caught something at the ER it would be my fault she got sick. Honestly I was stunned by this because I’d done a gold star job not behaving/talking to him like this burn injury was his fault because kids are super fast and idk what happened. I started crying about it and he insisted he’d take her to the ER.\n",

      "I have been a stay at home mom for 18 months. For the first year of my son's life, I had severe PPD. I spent a whole year immersed in severe depression. Please keep in mind, I have OCD, anxiety and depression regularly, but it was managed...but after childbirth it amplified by 1000x.  Now that things that have calmed down with new meds and occasional bumps in the road, I'm realizing how difficult it is being a stay at home mom. I've experienced exhaustion and burnt out that I've never felt in my whole life. I find managing my house a never ending and daunting task. My anxiety gets triggered easily, and my son is at the age when he needs me 24/7, and I get so tired easily.  I have mom friends, but I find myself bored and lonely during the week. I have thought about going back to school to become a psych technician, because mental health and helping others that suffer the things I've had throughout my life is something that feels fulfilling to me... but I feel guilty about doing that. I am not required to work, my husband makes a steady pay check.... but the fact that I'm choosing to move forward with something like this instead of choosing to stay home with my son, makes me feel like a *horrible parent*. I love my son so much, and him and my husband are my life, but I feel like the stay at home burn out doesn't make me a better parent. \n",

      "I need some help with my 14 yo male. We are a family of 5. 18 months, 4 years old and 14 year old. We have a loving home. Admittedly, it is a bit chaotic, particularly with the cost of living, and having to work a lot to get by. Our oldest is starting to talk to us rudely. He is quite lazy and in my mind (maybe I am being too hard on him) is spoilt (has a phone, gaming computer on weekends, a basketball court in the back we built for him, plays rep basketball and club basketball which is a big financial commitment).\n",
      "\n",
      "He gets plenty of phone time and he can game on weekends. In terms of doing chores it is a slow burn. There is a lot of opposition to do chores or simple things like cleaning his room. I know this is all normal teenage stuff and we need to keep it positive and not let privilege take place (eg gaming) without room being clean.\n",
      "\n",
      "What my biggest issue is right now is blaming everybody but himself. It is quite extreme. For example, if he forgets to organise his uniform the night before, he will blame his mum for not cleaning it for example. If he hasn't completed his homework (and we receive a call from the school) he tells the teacher he was away over the weekend (which isn't true). He recently got caught using AI for an English assignment. He denied it to the very end. I am 99% confident there were a few paragraphs that were enhanced using AI. If he can't find something in his room his immediate response is to blame either myself/his mum or his siblings. He even blames his friends and throws them under the bus on occasion. I could give plenty of other examples but in summary he has a chronic habit of blaming others and it is becoming so frustrating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love him with all my heart but I am incredibly exhausted in terms of his accountability. He is usually good with his siblings (other than annoying his sister a lot).\n",

      "He has been disrupted in terms of school as we had to move a few times due to my health (cold weather was bad for my chronic pain). We also had some unforeseen financial woes and we had withdraw from a fee paying school. So he has a school change during his school. I also feel we could spend more time with him. We could always be better that I definitely acknowledge. \n",

I’ve always had anxiety and have been on Celexa for years with great balance, only taking low-dose Klonopin, maybe less than once a month for events. By week 12, I was doing extremely well. Still uncomfortable, but I was stable throughout pregnancy.  \n",

But week 3, my ovulation threw me for a loop, so with my doctor’s approval, I upped to 20mg.

I get hot and cold, and feel in a constant fight or flight. My mind is focused on work, baby, making dinner, then it just hits so deep & intense where I can’t function. My poor, amazing husband is putting up so much. Usually, I'm the strong one, emotionally anyway.  \n",

      "Hi everyone. I have a 4 month old (3 months adjusted) and we just took a 2 week trip to Tennessee from California. Towards the end of the trip it kind of seemed like he was going through a growth spurt since he was eating a bit more and sleeping more. \n",
      "\n",
      "But ever since coming back the other day, he’s turned into a different baby. He’s crying and screaming throughout the day, he’s crying during car rides and walks which he used to love, and he’s screaming during his bottle feeds and not drinking nearly as much. I adjusted the temp of the formula and even downsized him from a size 2 nipple to a size 1 since he started to choke and gurgle on his formula. But nothing has helped. He’ll start screaming halfway through the bottle and it’s so hard to finish 4-5 oz when he was drinking 6 oz regularly before. He handled size 2 just fine before the trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really stressed out about the feeding specifically, but the crying throughout the day doesn’t help. I’m not sure what to do or if this is even normal? I can’t imagine the growth spurt lasting this long or even causing him to eat less. He was eating 32-34 oz before the behavior change and it’s dropped to 26 oz for the last 2-3 days. \n",

My baby started eating it, seemed to be ok. I was giving him super tiny bits, like literally a few oats with each bite.

      "\n",
      "Hi everyone, just looking for other perspectives on something. My husband has a 22yr old female cousin who he sees in the context of family functions about every 3-4 months. They otherwise don’t text/communicate nor do they spend much time hanging out or talking during family functions. They’re close in the context of the entire family is close but not individually with each other. \n",
      "\n",
      "This cousin has been very interested in our baby- offering to babysit, joking/asking to be the godmother even though we never said we’d be baptizing, posting photos of our baby on her social media, asking to come see the baby outside family functions etc. This is all whatever- what i’m feeling unsure about is how she is around the baby. She says to the baby every time we see her in a flat, monotone voice “I missed you”, “I missed you so much”, “I’ve been counting down the days to see you” “I love you”. All with an intense stare and no facial expression. She often stares at the baby and strokes her hair or rubs her back. She is always asking to hold the baby and when we say not right now for whatever the reason and later if we give the baby to someone else she gets upset that she asked first and starts pouting and whining. Sometimes her dad steps in and tells her enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recently at a family bbq she was sitting beside the baby who was in her high chair. She put her arm around the baby and leaned in and was stroking her hair and staring intently at her nonstop for at minimum 5 minutes while the baby ate. No smile, didn’t talk to the baby, just intense staring with no facial expression. It sort of creeped me out. The baby started fussing for more food at one point and the cousin kept telling everyone the baby was just crying for attention multiple times claiming “I can tell, she is just crying for attention” until her sister sternly said her name. Later I briefly left the table to get something and when I returned the cousin was trying to feed my one year old a large, hard chunk of iceberg lettuce off her dirty fork. I pushed it away and politely said “oh she can’t have that yet it’s a choking hazard. Also we don’t share germs with the baby”. The cousin turned her head away from me and began laughing silently into her arm. I saw her look at the others and smile as she turned away and her body was shaking with laughter. I was confused at her reaction to be honest so I just sat back down. Later when she was leaving she picked up my baby to say goodbye and sat the baby on the couch beside her for some reason. Baby tried to crawl away so the cousin just shrugged and stood up and walked off- leaving my baby crawling to the edge alone on the couch. My MIL happened to be standing by them and quickly grabbed my baby as she was about to go over. She never said goodbye to me despite saying bye to everyone else and just left after abandoning my baby on the couch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, I don’t want to overthink or overreact, but this behavior has me feeling off about her. She just comes off as a bit creepy in how she shows affection and talks to my daughter and now she seems to be a bit of a safety risk. I’m also not sure how to feel about her turning away and laughing after I told her the baby couldn’t eat the lettuce. It just seemed inappropriate. Any thoughts? \n",

Every stage my first 2 went through I chalked up to developmentally difficult ages, but as they grow older I have increasing concerns for ADHD or ODD. I’m having them both evaluated but it will take time. I started out parenthood firmly against corporal punishment and harsh words, opting for the gentle parenting approach with the goal of being an authoritative parent. Over time between a full time job, a less than supportive partner, graduate school, and many big life events, I have turned into this monster that has to yell and spank almost daily. No approach seems to work. Maybe it’s the culmination of having everyone home for the summer with a first responder shift working spouse and trying to do my grad school work around my babies - but I feel so lost. I mourn the type of mom I wanted to be. I mourn the childhood I feel like my children deserve, but at the same time, I don’t know what to do. Their behavior is so bad. The summer started out with a daily routine of a long walk, swim lessons, outings, outside play, indoor activities, but slowly the tantrums and the sibling fights have just made it miserable. I’ve fallen off the routine because it was too much for just me, and I’m sure this has led to a further decline in all of us. \n",

      "My newborn has severe reflux (trialing omeprazole) and is constantly forcefully spitting up and chokes/aspirates on her spit up even hours later, has slow weight gain in the beginning, and is overall just very hard. I’ve had to change my diet dramatically because her GI is all wonky and have to constantly try different feeding positions to see it that helps keep food down. She been to the doctor 5 times, has had one ultrasound, and one trip to the emergency room… this baby is only 6 weeks old. Now she has eczema on her face and neck, but I’m not even going to get into that right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I am laying out this context is because I can pinpoint why my anxiety is getting worse and feel like I might feel normal again once we get past these hurdles. The problem is that now I feel like I am LOOKING for things that are wrong. Every twitch I assume is a seizure, every mucous stool I assume means cystic fibrosis or GI blockage, every arching of her back I assume means meningitis…. I can’t turn off the noise and it’s affected my ability to bond with my baby. I’m afraid to put her down because I think she will either choke or scream, but I’m afraid to hold her because then I will analyze.\n",

      "I guess what I am looking for is your experience with Zoloft postpartum. I’m not sold on the idea of starting medication in fear of being more flat than I am right now and I don’t like that it’s a big commitment.

Then there is the other room that was probably supposed to be the master its simple square and functional. We had the girls in the cute room when I was pregnant and during the first few newborn months and they where so scared of it. Crying non stop never wanting to be there i tried to make it nice and cozy for them but they hated it so I moved them into the \"master\" room and turned the old bedroom just into the toy room. They are okay with this set up now all 3 sleep in the old master bed room. My 19mo boy is showing me he is ready for a toddler bed and I am ready for that too but here's the problem. If he stays in the room with his sisters (who are working on and fully potty trained) I'm scared of them leaving to go potty and not closing the door and having him fall down the steps. I'm also scared that if he is left free he could get into somthing small and choke. I could move him into the play room but I really hate the idea of his sisters thinking hes favored down the line because he got his own room or have him feel alone. His sisters like to read to him or include him in their early morning games. Dose any ome have any suggestions? \n",

      "My newborn is 2 weeks old and my letdown is crazy. I have to lie down and lean back, with my baby belly to belly in order to breastfeed him without him choking and sputtering. The few times he has choked on my breast milk I want to cry. I feel AWFUL and I’m already starting to consider just pumping and bottle feeding. How am I ever going to be able to go out in public and feed him? I can’t just lie down and feed him wherever I am! I’m so disheartened. I so badly just want to be able to feed him on demand for at least 6 months, but a year is ideal… I just don’t know how that will be possible. It’s such a chore to nurse him. I’ve started to pump past my first letdown since that one seems to be the worst, but it’s so much work and often my baby is crying while I’m desperately trying to quickly pump for a minute or two until that first letdown stops. I guess I could always just bottle feed pumped milk when I’m out, and then breastfeed at home if I have to. Anyone deal with an overactive letdown? Does it ever get better? I need some hope that it won’t always be this way. 😭 TIA!\n",

      "\n",
      "I'll preface this by saying my husband and I have fought three times over this already and frankly I'm writing this out more as a very long vent than a question.  I can't even vent to anyone about this because my friends and family straight up would think this is just incredibly dumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had been giving string cheese whole to our toddler (a little under 2.5 y/o) without issue almost daily since she turned 2.  I always supervise her with it but my husband doesn't - it's a pattern with him where he just leaves her to do whatever while he goes upstairs to get ready and shower.  In the past, when she was only a year old, he would also leave her downstairs while he went upstairs to shower despite me telling him to at least bring her into the bathroom with him (with some toys) so he can see her. \n",
      "\n",
      "A couple weeks ago, I came downstairs to find my daughter crying and then she stopped making crying sounds but was still really upset - I look over and it's clear something isn't right, at which point I realize that she has a whole lot of something in her mouth and I tell her to spit it out, except she can't. So I reach in and scoop it out and it's a big wad of melted string cheese, some of which I fished back out of her throat.  I don't know if it was already melted/softened by the time she tried to eat it, or if the heat of her keeping it in her mouth for a long time melted it, but it was melty enough to pull/stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tell my husband who's upstairs what happened and he starts yelling at me that it wasn't string cheese, it was a whole Babybel cheese (which we've also given to her whole, she likes to peel it) and getting angry at me for telling him she was choking on string cheese. He's adamant it wasn't string cheese (and denied giving it to her) even though I told him I literally took it out of her mouth and it got to the point that I told him to look in the trash can to see for himself that it was string cheese.  *I'm* angry at this point because she just choked and his concern is over whether it was cheese he gave her or \"something she picked up around the house.\" A couple minutes later he's still upstairs and I found the actual string cheese plastic wrap on the sofa, which I brought upstairs to show him.  The end result (I'm skip the rest of the arguing back and forth) was that I told him to always supervise her when she's eating string cheese because she can choke on it and he agreed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then this morning my daughter comes upstairs to tell me that she phuw-ed (we taught her to spit it out if she puts too much food in her mouth to swallow, or like with toothpaste). I asked her what it was and she said it was cheese. Now I'm alarmed because she loves cheese and she never spits it out like other food that she chews for a long time but ends up not wanting to swallow (usually meat or fibrous vegetables) and she obviously was not being supervised when all this went down.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I bring it up with my husband and cue another argument, he goes on and on about how he's given string cheese to her so many times and she doesn't choke on it, she only choked on it last time because she was crying, etc.  I point out that a kid can eat grapes 1000 times and still choke on the 1001th time, that's why it's a choking hazard. I told him to look it up himself. He argues back and forth, says \"but she was fine\" because I was there (and my point is that he wasn't...the first time or this second time) and we get to the point where he says ok, he'll cut it up.  I only told him to supervise whenever she eats it and I reiterated my point, but that's what he goes to. He also aggressively questions at what age it stops being a hazard. I told him I don't know but I can look it up and that he needs to look it up himself to see that it is actually a choking hazard. I even pointed out that adults have died from choking on melted mozzarella sticks, it's a known thing.  The argument got to the point where I told him that even if 99% of kids who eat something don't choke, that doesn't mean that thing is not a choking hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "He STILL blows up again and tells me he just doesn't think it's a choking hazard and maybe I think it is but it's not. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, I was a firsthand witness to my choking daughter and not only did he start out by not believing it was string cheese - which I pointed out makes it seem like he thinks I was lying to him or something, whereas he just keeps saying it was reasonable for him to not believe it because she's eaten it at least 50x before - his attitude about it *even now* is still that he'll do it to appease me but he's made it clear he thinks I'm an idiot about this.  He even went as far as to ask me what do I mean by \"supervise\" her and I told him - supervise her so if she chokes on it he'll see it and actually know it's happening.  Seriously. \n",
      "\n",
      "In general he's very lax on safety and I would say I already am pretty relaxed myself about things, but the difference is that after all this happened, I specifically told him to watch her when he gives it to her and he straight up chose not to. Then when I brought it up to him he's still arguing and keeps questioning what's the point of the conversation (for him to supervise her when she's eating string cheese, which I've told him 10x) and has decided it's really about my \"hurt feelings.\"  I can't even at this point.\n",

      "\n",
      "- We have a 5 year old boy, a 3.5 year old boy, and a 18 month girl\n",
      "\n",
      "Problem:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our middle child’s behavior is causing me to hate being around him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I relate more to his older brother and always have. We like to sort things, follow rules and directions, play games together, do legos, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 3.5 year old definitely sees this and acts out. If I’m playing with his brother, he has to be involved whereas if I’m playing with his sister, he doesn’t mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "He is constantly touching me, squeezing me, choking me around the neck with hugs, but then gives me a kiss and says that he just wanted a hug or kiss. \n",
      "\n",
      "He is always amped up. He’s always at a 10 of energy. It takes years for him to fall asleep at night despite taking our pediatrician’s advice of magnesium chews (which work fine on his brother). She thought maybe he isn’t getting enough sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "He throws things at people when he has even the slightest bit of annoyance. But then immediately says sorry and gives them a hug or kiss. One time he did a running kick on his baby sister for touching his fort and it was so brutal. \n",
      "\n",
      "He provokes his brother constantly for attention but it always becomes negative attention where his brother then hits him because HE is annoyed now. \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve noticed he responds well to being thrown on things like his nugget, crash cloud, or couch (also a great way for me to get out my frustration 😅). But I’m tired and sore. \n",
      "\n",
      "We have three kids under 5 and full time jobs so while we try to do individual activities with the boys, it’s just impossible daily with a needy baby and just trying to survive the day to day of this life right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "When we do give him individual time consistently, it didn’t seem to help. In fact it almost made it worse where he expected our attention to ONLY be on him the rest of the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m at my wits end here. I know he’s 3. I know he needs more attention. We just literally can’t give it to him all the time. We have three kids all needing our attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "The pediatrician is seeing him again in a couple weeks as a follow up the magnesium suggestion. I’m hoping to get a referral to a therapist or some kind to help us learn what he needs that we can actually do. \n",

      "I’ve been terrified of solids since my baby turned 6 months. But, LO is 8.5 months old now and I've been doing not real BLW but more traditional \"texture timeline\" progression, but he's been self feeding with a spoon and he's been doing pretty well as mashes have gotten a little chunkier. However lately he's been preferring being fed so we've been spoon feeding more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today I gave him sweet potato with ground beef which I blitzed in the blender so the beef was essentially crumbled in the mash. My husband was feeding him and he was doing fine with the first few bites and then all of a sudden my husband could sense something was wrong. Our baby stopped making sounds, wouldn't react to anything and all of a sudden started to turn RED (not blue). He looked confused and panicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I immediately grabbed him out of his high chair and started to do back blows on my thigh. I think it was 1-2 very hard blows and I saw a little chunk of beef/potato fly out and he started crying. It was pretty small, about the size of 1/2 pea, maybe. I didn't think that it could obstruct the airway but would a partial airway obstruction still need back blows like this?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of the most traumatizing experiences we've ever been through. And I'm still wondering HOW could this happen? I thought mashes/textures were fairly safe? There wasn't a single crumble of beef that was larger than a piece of quinoa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it just really bad luck? Was he not ready? Is this because we spoon fed him instead of letting him feed himself? Is there a CHANCE he wasn't actually fully choking? Regardless, I feel like I failed to keep him safe because I prepared the food and it clearly wasn't appropriate for him.\n",
      "\n",

      "Post 250: How to tell my mom LO is going to daycare\n",
      "\n",
      "Since early pregnancy, my mother has offered to watch our daughter for free when I return to work.   This was a relief so that I didn’t have to search for daycares and worry about a stranger with her all day while I work.   When I gave birth, she stayed with me (even though she lives 20 minutes away) for about six days to help me since I had a c section.  While she did not help me in some was as expected, it was kind of her to do.  I’ve been on maternity leave and return to work next week on May 1.  Baby will be 8 weeks old. \n",
      "\n",
      "When discussing our expectations, such as in our home vs her home we are met with resistance.  She doesn’t want to drive the 20 minutes here each day, she wants to stay the night for Sunday - Wednesday each week.  This is a huge F no.  She wants to watch her at her house but drop off and pick up for us would be wildly time consuming and out of the way (40 minutes from our job) and my brother lives with her and is anti vax, no thank you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since birth, my mom has visited about once a week to see the baby.  She watched her once while I went to a new job interview.  In each instance, I’ve had an issue with some of her care.   \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, she thinks she knows best because she was very involved in raising my niece and nephew 20 years ago and obviously raised my brother and I.  She has however done zero research on recommended care since and takes zero constructive criticism or suggestions on how I want my daughter cared for.  For example, my daughter is pace fed as recommended by her doctor.  My mother continues to gravity feed despite my insistence to pace feed, even when I provide information on why it is a better choice. She knows better.  But the problem is baby will drink too quickly and choke when gravity fed and it can lead to issues later in life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "She has also put her in her crib with a blanket, which was partially covering her face.  Thankfully this happened while I was home and I went into her nursery to see the baby and saw that she had a blanket near her face and quickly removed it.   My mom had placed her in there for a few minutes while she went to the bathroom, but as I explained to her, it only takes a few minutes for the baby to cover her face with the blanket and suffocate.  No blankets in her sleeping spaces.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she is constantly covering her with blankets in general.  The house is about 70 degrees. It’s sunny out, she’s dressed appropriately for the season.  But my mom insists on covering her with blankets to the point that she recently was overheating the baby.   I walked in and baby was red in the face and her back was wet with sweat.   I explained that she cannot let the baby get too warm and if she is red or sweaty we need to keep her cool.  Cold babies cry, hot babies die.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Any time I express an issue calmly and from an educational or science based reasoning she tells me I’m being over protective, obviously she’s not going to hurt my baby, I’m wrong and basically any excuse other than apologizing or addressing my concerns.   She just denies any wrong doing and reacts like I’m stupid for saying anything and plays the victim.  I’ve had enough and now I’m worried about her watching my baby unsupervised.  She has a history of not taking my requests into consideration when caring for my animals in the past, leading to health issues (for example feeding human food to my cat and my dog despite many direct requests to use their regular food only).   I will not allow the same to happen to my daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "This week, husband and I toured a daycare and are planning to enroll baby in 3-4 days a week.  MIL will watch the baby one day and respects all of our choices.  My mother is another story as mentioned above. We are considering offering my mother one day if she will follow our wishes on how to care for the baby. And if not she will go into day care 4 days.  I think that despite a tantrum, the risk of not seeing the baby may keep her in line.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m unsure how to break it to her without causing too many problems. She is a boomer and not going to take it well.  If she gets upset, it’ll be her problem - I want to do what’s best for my daughter and I’m not afraid to stand up for that, however I’d like to mitigate issues if possible - perhaps anyone has a kind way of phrasing the situation, reasonings etc without it seeming like I’m attacking her because that’s exactly how she’s going to take it and play the victim.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know what I need to do, I just wanted to know if anyone had help with phrasing lol I’m rambling at this point. \n",

      "Post 251: My marriage is failing\n",
      "\n",
      "My marriage is failling and I don't know what to do. I'm posting here in hopes of getting perspectives from other moms. I don't know if things are really as bad as I feel they are or if I have PPD, but I've been angry at my husband for 7 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "My problem with my husband: I had expected baby care to be 50/50, but it didn't turn out that way. I know this is a common theme amongst first time parents. I am now 8 months pp. At 2 months, my husband got covid and moved to the spare bedroom to recover, but since has never moved back. We both work full time. I work at an office, but it's a family business so I bring the baby to work with me. My husband works from home. So the daily schedule is: I sleep with LO in the master bedroom, do all night wakings and feedings (he's recently been starting to sleep through the night though, thankfully), my husband gets him up at 7:30 to feed/change him and load him in the car while I pump and get myself ready for work. I should mention I'm an exclusive pumper since LO never latched well, so I spend 2.5 hours every day pumping and then washing all bottles. My son and I go to work, and I try my best to balance work and caring for LO. At the end of the work day, we go home and my husband feeds/changes again while I pump. He makes dinner for us while I make dinner for LO. After we eat, my husband bathes LO while I shower. After I get out of the shower, I am on baby duty for the rest of the night (two feedings and then we go to bed), while my husband plays computer games for the rest of the night. Besides that, my husband takes out the trash, I do the dishes and laundry, plus 100% of the mental load such as managing doctor's appointments and wake windows and what allergens we have introduced already / how many times, etc etc. I don't have any time for leisure activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband's problem with me: He feels I am bossy and controlling. I do a lot of research on baby care, that's how I learned about wake windows, baby led weaning, etc. My husband is the type that just \"wings it\". I email him articles to read to try to collaborate with him on how we should care for our son, but he doesn't read any of them. So when he does something that I feel is \"wrong\" (such as giving him too small of a piece of food as a choking hazard, etc), I correct him. So yes, in that sense, I am bossy. But if he bothered to educate himself on these matters, then I wouldn't need to tell him what to do. I wish I didn't have to tell him what to do. His other problem with me is he feels he does plenty and that I'm unjustified in my dissatisfaction. Every time I ask for more help, he feels attacked and unappreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "With lots of resentment building up, it all came to a head two days ago. Since LO hasn't been waking to feed these past few weeks, he's been waking up earlier, around 6:00 AM. My husband knows that, but he still doesn't wake up until 7:30. So I feed/change LO before I pump. That morning I was particularly tired because LO is probably teething and didn't sleep well all night. He started crying while I was trying to pump, so I called my husband on his cell phone twice, but no answer. When he finally comes out of his bedroom at 7:30, I am already irritated. I know it's exacerbated by months of resentment. We get into an argument, and I accuse him of ignoring my phone calls on purpose. He gets angry at the accusation and tells me I should've gotten my \"lazy ass\" up and knocked on his door instead. Since that day, he has been ignoring me. He doesn't acknowledge my presence. When he gets angry he likes to \"punish\" me, so now he no longer makes dinner for me and only makes his own food. He doesn't feed or change LO anymore either. He takes him for 30 minutes twice a day to play with him only to spend time with him. I think his thought is that if I don't think he does enough, then I can just do it all myself. But I pretty much do already, so while it is a bit harder, I can manage. I asked him if he wanted to have a conversation, he said no, that he doesn't care about me anymore, and that he's only here for his son. We live in a house that I purchased before we started dating, so I told him if that's the case then move out. Then he called me a \"f\\*cking c\\*nt\".\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what my next steps should be. I want to try counseling for the sake of our son. But I am pretty much done with the marriage as well, though I know they say don't make any major decisions in the first year.  I don't want to give up on the marriage if it will get better after the first year, but I also don't want to be with someone that behaves this way, regardless of the situation. I think he plans on continuing to live in the same house while ignoring me and only interacting with his son. I don't know what to do because I don't want to live in that type of environment. If you've read this far, thank you and I welcome all advice and feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "EDIT: I appreciate everyone’s input, it really helps me see things more clearly. What I learned:\n",
      "1) I need therapy for my anxiety and control issues, he needs therapy for how he deals with anger and insecurity. We need couples therapy together.\n",
      "2) I need to lighten my load - put baby in daycare and transition to formula (those AAP recommendations are a real mindfuck).\n",
      "3) Lots of q’s about why husband never moved back to the bedroom. Obviously he doesn’t want his sleep disturbed. But more specifically, he’s addicted to gaming and with how late he stays up gaming, he can’t afford to be up with baby if he wants to be functional at work the next day. He mental gymnastics himself into believing I’m fine with doing all the MOTN wakeups, even though I’ve said time and time again that I’m not. That’s a whole separate issue, hopefully therapy will help.\n",
      "4) I need to stand up for myself. I’ll make it clear the next time he calls me that, it would be the end of our marriage, if it’s not already too far gone.\n",
      "5) To those of you saying I had it pretty good or the childcare sounded equal, your standards for your men are far too low. But to each their own.\n",

He was born at 32 weeks, stayed in the NICU for a month. I’m having a hard time with feeding. We are exclusively bottle feeding with formula, Similac right after the hospital but shortly after being him we switched to the Enfamil version, it’s for premie babies and we’re doing a higher caloric dose. I’m struggling so much with my baby eating. He has such a random amount of food intake. Times he takes 4 ounces (which are rare) and times where he drinks 1 ounce, more consistently he drinks 2 ounces. He’s about 2 months adjusted age. Has anyone experienced this? I’m feeling so helpless. He’s gaining weight but very slowly. He hasn’t thrown up which became frequent for a bit there. Speech therapy says it’s most likely his reflexes not integrating yet, and time will help but idk.. waiting feels wrong. We are doing a swallow study later this month to hopefully rule out anything bad. I know premies come with their fair share of hardships but i’m so frustrated and scared. I’m scared he’s not as healthy as he could be. I am grateful he’s not loosing weight… i need advice. \n",

      "He does not have LM, and per our initial swallow study the aspiration amount is trace, but consistent. We are going to an aerodigestive clinic in a few weeks, but I am concerned they will push a feeding tube due to thickening not solving the aspiration during the initial swallow study. He is happy, thriving, and hitting milestones. He is 90% for weight so a tube just seems very invasive and we are concerned about doing a tube at this stage in his development when he should be starting to focus on solids. \n",

      "I was also getting to that age where I was thinking about my next steps in life. Was I going to have a family or not? \n",
      "I thought about a family I was a nanny for in college. A woman who was heavily pregnant and her husband who worked for a flooring company. I watched their young twins. She was gorgeous, intelligent, and a nurse. She did everything right. Went to nursing school, was responsible, organized. And yet her life was so hard. She was working long days on her feet at eight months pregnant with bronchitis. All because she had no paid maternity leave and had to save all of her sick days for after the baby was born. I thought something was wrong with this situation and it solidified my unease for staying where I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw my life going into a direction that I felt I had little control over. I saw a life called middle class that was really poverty, living paycheck to paycheck, barely scraping by, living at the mercy of one’s employer, underneath all of it. I saw that I was never going to escape my messed up family members. I wanted to do something drastic. So I eloped with my boyfriend who had dual citizenship and moved to a Scandinavian country. \n",

      "The move was hard and we struggled to find work at first. I struggled with alcoholism for a short time as well but changed my group of friends and live a healthy lifestyle today. Finally after a few years I had a good career, owned an apartment, had a good marriage and a few good friends. I felt like I’d ’made it’. There’s nothing that can describe that feeling of wanting to pat your former self of the back and say ‘good job, you saved us’. And I felt like that most days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward a few years and we have two adorable kids. We are supported by an amazing security net here. We have virtually no stress. I took months of paid sick leave when I was pregnant to rest. I took 8 months of paid maternity leave with both kids and pay very little for childcare. My husband also had months of paternity leave. My husband and I get a combined 20 sick days a year just to take care of our kids when they are sick. That’s not even counting our own sick days.\n",

      "The childcare is also very high quality. They are outside the majority of the time, rain or shine. They go sledding in the winter at the daycare, jump in puddles when it’s raining. Kids here are really ‘free’ to be kids. The people who work there are happy, not very stressed because all their bills are paid too, and so the vibe is just happy and free at the daycare.\n",
      "\n",
      "It feels like everyone in this country has only ‘luxury’ problems. There are no homeless people. Everyone has a living wage. It’s very hard to get fired or laid off from your job due to some really strict workers rights laws. I used to have this crazy fear of being fired from my job and destitute when I lived in the USA. I don’t have that fear anymore. I told them I’m only coming back part time after this maternity leave and am worry free, because they literally can’t fire me unless I do something crazy. You will be taken care of if you get too sick to work. Of course some people have real problems but compared to living in the USA it feels like a utopia. \n",

Here, addicts and mentally ill people can live in dignity, off the streets with housing and spending money.

We stayed with my parent who promised to not bring my addict sibling into the house, and then in the middle of the night she needed somewhere to stay and I almost had to drag my kids out of bed and go to a hotel until I convinced him to not let her in the house where my kids were sleeping. As a grandparent he’s mildly interested in my kids and generally unhelpful. My extended family were busy with their jobs and their families. We felt out of place with an active toddler and not much stimulation or routine for him. The flight home was even more brutal. Our toddler was awake the whole time and so we were too. The drive home from the airport we were both so tired that it was actually so dangerous to drive. Then there was the jet lag and getting my toddler back on the right time zone. It was just not worth it. Going home to visit is just not really an option until they’re older.\n",

It feels like we are mourning the loss of what could be, and it’s really hard. She’s said things like ‘you could move home’ and ‘I’m not going to see your kids grow up.’ It’s heart breaking. And my toddler is also really sad to hear that she’s leaving.\n",

      "Knowing that they will have no aunts and uncles or cousins living close by is a hard pill to swallow, especially when the research is clear that extended family support is so important in a child’s well being.

I can deal with my own homesickness and missing my sister, but what gets me is if having no extended family is doing more harm than life in the USA could do.\n",
      "I’d love to hear from children of expats who had no extended family what they think. I’d love to hear from parents in the USA what they think as well. After reading all of this, if they had to option would they want to move to a utopian society in Scandinavia or would they rather stay in the USA.\n",

Sometimes my 6 month old holds the spoon and brings it to his mouth for self-exploration, he doesn’t mind the mess and generally seems happy and safe.

SIL ended up blowing up on my husband and defended his parents (I was unaware there was a side to defend, we simply asked and reminded them not to kiss his face (especially lips, I likely would have just let it go if it was the cheek). SIL ended up taking a shit on me politically, spewed out some anti-vax rhetoric about public health, and confessed that her and her husband don’t like me/implied that no one else did either. Apparently MIL called her to bitch as soon as they got in the car to drive home.\n",

      "FIL blew up and lost his mind. Told us that they aren’t comfortable here, slammed his fists on the table, pointed blame at me - that I create discomfort (no explanation but it’s apparently entirely my fault), that this never would have happened if I had “just let her kiss her grandson goodbye and didn’t rip him away from his own grandmother”. Yelled at me (!!), told me I was disrespectful and refused to say that he cares or loves me when prompted by my husband. Plenty of other unhinged behavior but that was the gist of it. I was primarily silent on the phone call and let my husband lead. FIL stormed out of the room, MIL was caught in the middle but did continue to reiterate that she didn’t understand why she couldn’t kiss him, made herself to be a victim, and acted quite cold towards me. \n",
      "\n",
      "After more conversations between my husband and his family and a phone call between me and my MIL - the truth has surfaced. SIL and FIL don’t like me - they’ve had constant phone calls over the last year or so (since having a baby) about how they don’t care for me and have created a false narrative that I have and continue to intentionally take my husband away from his family - simply based on the notion that we moved 2.5 hours away and started our own. Any boundaries (like not kissing baby) were viewed as an attack on them and assigned to be my decision alone when these are choices that my husband played an equal role in making. MIL is caught between her family and said she is having a hard time managing FIL and SIL’s anger. However, she told me that she agrees I have at times been disrespectful - and explained how she’s upset about a pan I forgot to wash before returning to her 5 years ago, and that “it was extremely disrespectful and shows what kind of person you are”. Dead ass serious. I asked her if she was also upset that her son forgot to wash the pan and whether or not that was disrespectful but she said no, that \"it's just men being men\". She told me she doesn’t agree with her husband and her daughter otherwise but simultaneously told me “I do feel uncomfortable when we’re there”. I asked her why and she said that everyone “seems stressed”.\n",

      "For context - they do not ask to help us and never have when they are here. FIL constantly rolls his eyes at me and has made passive aggressive comments towards me regarding parenting decisions like limiting container time, etc. We are understandably stressed as they come on Friday evening after we’ve both been working from home with our son all week and we have had a colic baby turned very spirited and high needs toddler who doesn’t sleep (and they have been constantly dismissive with comments like “honey, all babies cry”). I asked her if she has considered that our stress stems from that and she agrees but seems persistent that it’s a me problem that should change for them. I asked again if there was something I’m doing or not doing to make them uncomfortable - she said no, it’s just a feeling, and I should make an effort to make her and her husband feel more wanted, involved, welcomed, etc. \n",

      "Ya’ll - I thought I had a good relationship with these people. I clean and set up the house before they come. I cook food and we buy groceries we wouldn’t normally purchase - we take them to lunch. I am the first (and only) person to step in the kitchen when they've hosted and cook, clean, help with anything. Every holiday since I met my husband we have prioritized his family over mine. Every holiday and birthday I am picking out gifts for them and sending hand written cards, texts, photos. Telling them how much I love and appreciate them. SIL/BIL even more so, as we are all close in age. And still - I have been met with eye rolls and plenty of discomfort created for me that I’d chosen to ignore and not take personally. \n",

She left a glass of chocolate liqueur in Timmy’s room last year and he drank most of it. She hot boxed their car with weed and then showed up to dinner with Timmy in the backseat. Timmy is half Mexican and she has said Mexicans are stupid and lazy in front of him and calls him her “little beaner.” I could go on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is where I’m probably a dick. I don’t care for Timmy either. In a shock to no one due to his lack of parenting, he is ill-mannered, badly behaved, hyperactive, and largely unsupervised. He is rough with my son, takes his toys, and bosses him around. Example: My parents got my son a little tikes car for Easter and Timmy was pushing him around in it. When my son tried to get out, Timmy told my son no, to stay in it, then tried to shut the door on my son’s arm to keep him from getting out. He didn’t think anyone was watching. I am always civil with him and his mom but I don’t have a desire to maintain a relationship with this kid and I’m not interested in him having a relationship with my children either.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I know that I don’t exactly handle the situation well so I largely just supervise their interactions from a distance and intervene when I absolutely have to. No one else does. The rest of my family encourages the boys as I stand by gritting my teeth and swallowing heart palpitations. I know that if I say what I want to I’ll be the biggest dick in the room and I anticipate hearing that in the comments. I get it. I wish I was better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When my son was born Timmy was all over him. He had to constantly be reminded - don’t touch his face, don’t touch his hands, don’t take his teethers, don’t jump around him while he’s laying on the floor. All of this from me or my husband, never his own parents. It was constant stress for me. And now I’m gearing up for another. A month after this one is born we’re taking a family vacation with my whole family. I’m preparing to protect my peace by being the bad guy and putting down the boundary - Timmy, do not go anywhere near the baby. No, you can’t hold him. And simultaneously supervising him and my toddler in the process because no one else sees it as an issue.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I really needed to just get this out. I’m sure it’s largely in part due to my hormones and impending delivery but again, it gives me so much stress. I always enjoy the discussions on this sub and felt this might be a good place to share my frustrations. 🥲  \n",
      "\n",
      "ETA: In light of all the comments mentioning it, I thought I’d add this here. In the time we have known her, CPS has been called on her *multiple* times with multiple visits. So many times that she bitches about it constantly and posts about how annoying it is on her facebook. No action has been taken. 🫤\n",

      "Hi, everyone. \n",
      "My 9 yo son started taking Depakin 5 days ago. It’s really bitter, but what we have found to work is he takes a spoon of honey and swallows some of it so to coat his throat. First 2 days were not a good show lol he was making horror noises and complaining a lot, but he took it half an hour ago as if nothing happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday and today, he went for a play date at our neighbours’ house. At 18:30, he came home, took his medicine and ran straight back to play. \n",

      "\n",
      "I explained that him being still a child means that he’s never alone anywhere and a trusted adult is always present. For field trips, for example, his teachers would be in charge of giving him the medicine and keep an eye on him and I’d sign the papers to inform them on the time/exact dosage. For going to the movies, I suppose I’d tell his best friend’s dad/mum about it. \n",
      "\n",

      "I’m gonna be honest: I/we am/are pretty sheltered on this topic. I know children of friends of friends who have, say, diabetes, and they’re used to taking their insulin, checking their sugar levels etc. all on their own. \n",
      "This is his first time taking a medication for longer than a week, and I’m probably worrying too much about it, but I need advice on how, if it’s even appropriate, to foster independence in this area. I told him I might let him take it himself under our guidance for a few days, see how he’s responsible with it, then he might get permission to take it outside of the house. I’m thinking of getting him a smartwatch so he can get an alarm when it’s time to take it, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also kind of a dumb question: for liquid medication, how do you deal with transportation etc.? I don’t know if I can let him take the whole bottle with him. He takes it with a needle-less syringe, so my first thought was to pre-dose it and putting a “cork” on the end, but what if something happens to it? Would I put two? Argh I feel so stupid, I’m sure there are parents who figured this out by day 1 in here lol 😭\n",

      "In all my years of being a nanny, I’ve never had a child that couldn’t eat independently at 3 1/2 years old so i don’t know how to do this or how to teach him. He’s had a strict eating and drinking schedule his whole life. He doesn’t know how to express when he’s hungry or thirsty & never has said either. He started eating solids much later at about 18 months & started off very slow, literally only a tablespoon a day. Hes use to being fed all of his meals. For a while his parents would turn on the tv to get him to sit & focus so that they could feed him. He was using a highchair up until I would say about 18 months and then they stopped because they didn’t want him to be restricted to the chair. For awhile They would let him play while he was eating & almost had to chase him around the room to get him to eat. His parents work from home & have a 20 year old daughter with non verbal autism that they take care of as well so they didn’t have the time to sit there while he slowly ate. He still gets a lot of puréed food & he’s very slow when it comes to chewing & eating. We need to remind him almost every time he swallows to then take a bite. Hell stop chewing so we have to remind him to chew. It takes him about 20 minutes to eat 1/4 piece of toast with peanut butter. He’s constantly distracted with things around him while eating. He’s either staring outside, playing with his hands and feet, talking etc. or he’s playing with the food, playing with the fork, etc.\n",

He also gets a large cup of warm milk three times a day and I would say it was about a month and a half ago that we started giving it to him in a cup that he sips from instead of him laying down and drinking it from a sippy cup. \n",

I found a piece of it stuck to his neck by his drool and I checked his mouth to see if there were any pieces in there but I didn’t see any.

      "My SIL (Julia) gave birth 2 months + 3 days ago to a little (2.85 kg) baby girl Amanda. We live in Europe in a country that's pushing for breastfeeding, no matter what. So Julia was very keen on breastfeeding. The baby lost a lot of weight in the first week (I don't remember how much exactly) and has been seen by multiple doctors since then. \n",
      "\n",
      "In her first month of life, the baby gained weight up to 3.2 kg. My mum has asked Julia multiple times to give the baby formula because the baby was constantly crying and had hunger cues. My mum breastfed all of us (5 children), and she's very supportive of breastfeeding. She was just very worried about little Amanda. But Julia kept refusing, saying that only her milk counts and she won't be poisoning her daughter with formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "On her monthly checkup, the doctors said that Amanda is starving and she needs to eat. And so my SIL started going to multiple lactation consultants... They told her to pump around the clock, to top up the feedings with pumped milk, etc. But she refused to give Amanda a bottle because she said that if she introduced the bottle, then Amanda would never latch again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she started feeding her like 20 ml of milk after each feed with a kind of feeding tube she put in Amanda's mouth (I don't know what to call it).\n",

      "Amanda didn't gain any weight for another one and a half weeks, even though she was nursing every three hours around the clock (each feed 50 minutes) + top-ups. Julia asked her mum friends for milk donations, and she started using that milk in the same manner for top-ups because she was able to pump only 50 ml per day. That's when Amanda gained a tiny bit of weight (3.45 kg)\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, one and a half weeks ago, another lactation consultant told her that she needs to top up each feed with 80-90 ml of pumped milk, and she started doing it. And Amanda finally calmed down and started gaining weight (she's now 3.79 kg as of today).\n",
      "\n",
      "They also had her checked for tongue tie, and she didn't really have one, but just a tiny bit of slightly thickened frenulum. They had solved the same day (one week ago).\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, my SIL visited a lactation consultant, and she told Julia that now she can give Amanda less milk as a top-up since the baby is gaining weight, and they want to check if the smaller amount of milk for one week will still make Amanda gain some weight. My mum is terrified of this idea because she doesn't want to see Amanda starving again, especially now that she has finally started looking pink instead of grey.\n",

      "My brother doesn't really care because he follows whatever Julia is saying...\n",

      "We don't know what to do. We know that breastfeeding is important for babies and mothers. We admire all the women who do this. But this became total craziness. Julia is constantly talking about nursing and pumping, nursing and pumping, there's nothing that matters to her more than breastfeeding. We told her multiple times that she's a wonderful mum and she should relax with this, and de-stress, and sometimes other options might be better for both the mum and the baby. But she won't listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's power pumping once a day, taking supplements, pumping regularly 8 times per day, and she's only leaving the house for a visit to a doctor's or lactation consultant. Amanda doesn't even go outside for a walk in the stroller... The only time Julia is taking her out is when they're driving to an appointment.\n",
      "\n",
      "She's managing now to pump around 100 ml per day, and the lactation consultants are telling her that soon she will be able to fully breastfeed Amanda. Except that the feeds still take around 50 minutes, and without top-ups, Amanda would be admitted to the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want Julia to be happy, but she says she's happy when Amanda is nursing, and the most important thing for her is to experience her breastfeeding journey. We don't know what to do. We don't know how to talk to her. \n",

Then she ended up taking a nap and felt feverish. Her underarm temp was 100.4. I gave her meds and she was better. She ate and then got tired again and took a nap, then her fever came back so we took meds again (this time it was 101.2) She woke up super sweaty and hasn’t had a fever again since the meds worn off and she hasn’t vomited again. Could anyone tell me what this could be? I have a 6 month old baby and I’m scared it’s the stomach bug and I need something to ease my mind! We took an at home test for Covid and flu for my 5 year old and she was negative. Could this just be food poisoning? Does it sound like food poisoning? We’ve never experienced this before. We’ve had norovirus before and it was A LOT of vomiting and it was aggressive vomiting without being able to keep down water. And this isn’t anything like that. Any advice please!

It made me uncomfortable, but what's the worst that can happen. We eat dandelions and a googled it and all parts of the dandelions are edible. My wife got really mad, her logic is what else will my kids add to their tea. There aren't anything poisonous in our year, but there could be some weeds that make them sick. Am I taking a risk?\n",
      "\n",
      "The second one is about letting my daughter wander in the store. She's recently been very combatative when told what to do, so I figured letting her wander might let her feel a little freer. The store was pretty empty cause it was early, and she was never far from me. We kept whistling at each other too. We did have an issue last month where we were at the dollar store with both my girls and she followed a stranger out of the mall. I realized right away and she was gone for a minute but we were both terrified.\n",

      "This brought us to an argument about the risk. My wife is terrified that someone will kidnap out daughter. And she is really cute, but is that really a concern? I looked it up, there are 16 kids in my province that are kidnapped daily. Approx 50 per year in all of Canada are kidnapped by strangers. I feel like that risk is neglibile and the rewards are quite visible. \n",

      "My husband and I went through infertility for 18 months before conceiving our daughter. All I wanted was a baby. After finally getting pregnant, I ended up with preeclampsia and a blood pressure level of 181/114 and had to deliver at 36 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      " My baby was perfectly healthy but was only 4.8 pounds and ended up in the NICU for 16 days. She had to finish 3 feeds in a row without falling asleep  to have her NG tube removed. The grief and trauma I had (and I guess still have) from the NICU experience and having my baby taken from me was profound. To spend all day everyday in the NICU feeling like I had no autonomy over my child was hard. They made us feel like us being there to spend all day with her was an inconvenience to them. They condescended to us constantly and my husband and I both left every day feeling defeated. We would cry on the drive home. We felt like we weren’t even her parents. \n",
      "\n",
      "During her stay in the NICU she was so used to being bottle fed, that she refused to latch. So I was unable to breastfeed despite working with several lactation specialists. That was extremely emotionally painful for me. After being separated from my baby, all I wanted was that bond. In fact, I have massive boobs and the only reason I haven’t reduced them, was for fear of being unable to breastfeed. After 10 weeks of constant pumping, my milk dried out completely. My body just didn’t respond to pumping. \n",
      "\n",
      "She was an EXTREMELY fussy baby. We realized after a few weeks that because her digestive system was so premature she was temporarily allergic to cows milk protein. She had to go on a ($80 a week) hypoallergenic formula to help get rid of the constant reflux and painful constipation. The girl would scream for HOURS. \n",
      "\n",
      "She’s always been on the later end of “normal” as far as hitting her developmental milestones. But when she was about 14 months old, I started suspecting she was developmentally delayed and possibly autistic. EVERYONE in my life, including my husband was dismissive about it. Everyone was all “all babies are different” “she will get it eventually” “she will do it on her own time” and the one that pissed me off the most “she’s not autistic, she’s so friendly and playful” once around 15 months, my husband said “stop wishing autism on her” or “it’s like you WANT her to be autistic” after I expressed my concerns. That shit GUTTED ME. Because who the hell would WANT their child to be autistic? Like how tf do you even say that to a mother? \n",
      "\n",
      "When she was nearly 18 months I self referred her to Early Intervention in our state. They came and did multiple assessments and determined she had a “global delay” she passed in motor skills and adaptability. She is behind in social-emotional, cognitive, and both receptive and expressive language. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her pediatrician just referred her to DDBP for an assessment with a speech pathologist. Her EI therapist recommended we have her lead levels tested because our “renovated” home is 125 years old. \n",

      "We’re still waiting on her DDBP evaluation to come back and to find out whether or not they think she’s got ASD. But her lead tests came back elevated at 6.7\n",
      "\n",
      "Her delays became noticeable about 2 months after we moved into our house. Turns out, we have lead water pipes still. (Our landlord did not disclose this, so we’re taking legal action) We also have lead paint. So, potentially her delays are a result of the 10 months of lead exposure. It’s also possible that she has both autism and lead poisoning coinciding. We should know in a few weeks. We are abating the lead issue and planning to move out within the next month. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am beside myself with grief. I just want my child to succeed and to thrive. It is excruciating to watch your child struggle. She can’t communicate her needs to me at all. She just has this HORRIBLE guttural whine that she does. It grinds my nerves more than anything ever has in my life. I know it isn’t her fault, and I stay patient. But I want to scream sometimes. She doesn’t gesture, doesn’t shake her head yes or no. Literally no communication whatsoever outside of crying or whining. I model sign language and verbalize to her constantly, but so far, she isn’t receptive to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I hang out with friends that have children the same age and I see how far ahead of my daughter they are, it breaks my heart. We just spent the weekend with my best friend. Their daughter is 2 days younger than ours, and she is leaps and bounds ahead in development. Her husband was throwing a ball back and forth with their daughter and my husband had to leave the room because he started to cry. It is killing us both. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like I just have no one to talk about these feelings with. I feel guilty for grieving the experience that I expected/wanted to have as a parent. When I interact with other peoples kids and they are completely engaged with me, it makes me so fucking sad. That’s all I want with my own child. I talk to her, try to teach her things, and sing to her all day every day. It’s like talking to a brick wall. She doesn’t understand anything I’m saying. She can’t yet follow a single command. The only way I can get joint attention from her is through playing chase or spinning her around. If I provide her with some form of sensory input, she engages. But otherwise, it’s like I’m not even there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Social media is so hard because I’m seeing videos of kids a year younger than her that are more advanced than she is. I feel envious of everyone that has neurotypical children. And I feel shameful for that too. I was in therapy last year but just couldn’t afford the copay and had to pull out. I know I need to find a way to get back into it, because just spiraling over my own thoughts is doing me a disservice. I don’t know what the future holds and I’m still holding out hope that she can catch up to where she needs to be. But then I’m also fearful that she won’t. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve never said any of this out loud before and I’m not a journaler. But I just thought it could be cathartic to get it out. I’m doing everything I possibly can to help my baby succeed. And I know I should just be so grateful to have a child at all. Especially one who’s happy and healthy. But damn if some days I don’t want to just wallow in self pity.\n",

This morning, my husband took out the middle of the seats so the kids could have captains chairs like we had in our SUV. Business as usual, I loaded my 3.5 year old and 2 year old up for our daily running around. When we got back to the car, I let my 3.5 climb up into his seat by himself while I got my daughter buckled.

My husband is now just tired and weak but I'm still running to the bathroom while trying to take care of a toddler while my husband tries to recover quickly so he can go back to work tomorrow. I'm not sure if maybe my husband and I got food poisoning from some slightly undercooked pizza dough 2 days ago or if we managed to come in contact with another stomach bug somehow. I'm not running fever like I did last time so I'm not quite as miserable but I only slept 2 hours total since I spent most of the night in the bathroom. Anyway, I hate throw up. So I am absolutely terrified of my son getting this and having to take care of him being sick while I'm still sick too. I know in the moment I'll just do what has to be done but it sounds so daunting.

I can tell they think I’m too up tight and I think they were careless (in some ways) with their own kids. So there is a big misalignment with parenting in general. My kids are still young so our differences tend to be discipline and food choices (sugar). I’m not a crunchy mom but I certainly don’t load my kids up on sugar at all.\n",

      "Now to the point .. they are pretty careless about food safety. I am not, I may even be slightly OCD. I am meticulous about how raw chicken is handled, checking temp with a meat thermometer, not leaving food out, throwing out expired food, etc. They leave food out for way too long (4-5 hours is not unusual) and then try to feed my kids this food. I try to be diplomatic and just say no, we are eating at home. I don’t want to seem rude. \n",

I didn’t know what she was eating until I asked and when they told me I was horrified. The panic set in and I definitely was upset but tried to quell my feelings because maybe my kid would be fine. Well she had pretty bad diarrhea for the following 2 days. I was very angry to see my kid suffering with a wicked diaper rash and diarrhea and I obviously wasn’t happy about having to deal with a situation that could have been avoided.\n",

I say as calmly as possible “please stop feeding my children without asking me first.” And he then starts arguing with me saying the dip wasn’t sitting out long and I just walked away. He was drunk and had company. I was not about to make a scene. It’s very possible she will be fine but I don’t take unnecessary risks when it comes to my kids.\n",

He was generally raised differently than the rest of us, for example, myself the oldest (24F) had no cellphone until I was 17, couldn't sleep over at any friend's house until I was an adult, couldn't have \"violent\" toys, not even a plastic bow and arrow, etc. We used (all of us except the youngest) to be punished for balk-talk, missing homework, bad grades, refusing to eat, whining, etc. by ranges of kneeling for 30 min or being sequestered in our rooms for a day or more to a spanking with a wooden spoon and no going out with friends, no attending parties, no internet at all for an entire year (that was the most severe punishment one of us got, and that was because she was found with vape pens at 14).\n",
      "\n",
      " Since we moved from our home country to the US, however, it was like a complete switch had gone off in my parent's heads. He was spoiled beyond measure already since basically birth, from any toy he liked to any candy he fancied. But since moving here, he would back-talk my poor mum day and night and she'd 'try' to punish him by constraining him to his room, or taking his phone away, or similar, but then give it up less than a day in. My father attempted the same but similarly was unable to go through with punishments properly. Worse than this, the kid has a sense of entitlement that I'd never seen outside TV shows, and we (the rest of us kids) have been telling our parents they need to set clear expectations and punishments in order to achieve anything with him for YEARS. Now, he has had many many terrifying outbursts in the last year, the first of which were so severe we had to call the cops on him. \n",
      "\n",
      "What happened was: My mum had told him to clean his room everyday for two weeks straight and even explicitly explained to him twice that she would do it if he didnt. So one day he came home to his room being cleaned and he LOST HIS EFFIN MIND. Throwing tables and shelves around, yelling and screaming like a maniac, at one point he went to the kitchen to get a knife so he could \"kill myself you're all horrible I don't want to live anymore\". It might sound comedic but on god he sounded demented and the entire time yelling and screaming. We had to restrain him so he wouldn't hurt himself or us. We ended up calling the cops and they took him down to the ER for psychological assessment. The ER didn't do anything and the social worker assigned to the case just gave him a pep talk. We were reffered for family therapy, and that seemed to be working a little, until my father (notorious for his dislike of anything psychology and utter disregard and disdain for therapy specifically) went to one of these sessions and didn't like the way the therapist was talking to him, cue him threatening my mother with divorce if she ever even mentioned therapy again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since, my brother has had many many more outbursts. One of the most severe following my parent's discovery of him smoking weed at school through a drug test they brought, and a whole FBI-like investigation of his email and messaging app in which they discovered my idiot (I love him really but he's dumb) of a brother has been dealing? trading? drugs (we only really know about weed) and somehow (I cannot explain this at all, he would have to have met people outside of school and he only ever hangs out at school or at friend's houses with the presence of an adult) he managed to be one of the 'providers'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I want it to be clear, the proof for this is his attitude, moodiness, red eyes, the messages and emails which are more suggestive than anything, a concerned friend telling his mother who told our mother, and 3 vape cartridges found in his room, along with a bottle of piss, which I understand are used to pass drug tests, that my parents had him throw out. \n",
      "\n",
      "After this discovery, my parents started treating him more severely (mind they haven't discussed anything regarding his weed trading and positive test, just his attitude, which has been patently horrid, so bad one of his siblings refuses to return home from uni until late to avoid dealing with the drama) which made him even more angry and frustrated. He had a stomach ache one day they took him to the ER for it, but he refused my parents enter with him while he speaks to the doctor and was reportedly being an absolute rude ass to staff. He apparently was acting like a little king lashing out. He had such a breakdown that same day after going home that they HAD to call 911 on him AGAIN. My father is now convinced that my brother needs therapy (gee thanks), but has it in his mind that he has to send the kid to our home country, neighboring a WARZONE, where attitude like this is truly vilified (as in if he seems to disrespect his parents like this at all he would be immediately outcasted and then the only people he would associate with are not great in my opinion).\n",
      "\n",
      "To make things even bloody worse if that's possible, something happened today while they were out at the dentists, I don't know what, but apparently he has been acting the jerk again and being all bitchy in general, saying how he's gonna find himself a foster family and how we're a horrible family, and now my father has disowned him from being his son and refuses to speak to him or of him at all. \n",

      "\n",
      "We bought it for him under the recommendation of his therapists (both OT and Speech). He has autism, at the stage of Level 2. He avoids children no matter the environment he is in and prefers to stay by himself in a corner with objects that are the color blue. We go to the park, the museum, the zoo, play places more than three times a week. LO and I visit relatives his age in the evenings while dad is at work but it is the same avoidance despite constant invitation. Never has he been interested in toys like cars, blocks, and stuffed animals. He plays well enough with educational toys, however, and is quick at solving puzzles. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the issue at hand is social and play for him. He never has had interest in pretending. Last week, his therapist recommended getting a baby doll to help the process of being around children. I, being weirded out by dolls that have their eyes open, opted for one that looks like it is sleeping. We got it this morning, and I was shocked to find that it is quite lifelike. It has blush, painted veins, curled toes and fingers, and even a magnet in lips for keeping its pacifier in place. (oddly, it was cheaper to get compared to what you get from Walmart and such high quality to boot!)\n",

      "\n",
      "Ok so I work from home and honestly, the screen time struggle was eating me alive. Every time I needed to focus on a call or finish an email, my toddler would be right there asking for tablet. At first I gave in (bc survival lol) but it got to the point where screens were the default, not the backup. Last weekend I had enough. I decided to try setting up a super simple learning corner in the living room. Nothing fancy, just a little mat, a low shelf, and a few things I rotated in. I didn’t want more clutter, so I stuck to open-ended toys that don’t take up a ton of space. One of the best swaps I made was adding magnetic play sets (we got Tix and Mix, but I’ve seen similar brands too). My toddler goes wild making little scenes on the wall while I sneak in work time. It’s flat, sticks right on the wall, and actually looks nice in a small space so it doesn’t feel like toys exploded everywhere. What surprised me most is she actually stayed engaged for 20 straight minutes the first time. No whining, no begging for the iPad. She’s been going back to it on her own since then, which is HUGE for me. I’m not saying it’s magic and she never asks for screens anymore (lol I wish), but it gave me a way to cut it down without constant battles. I hope this would last for a while. lol\n",

      "This is an SOS to any and all moms who have gone through the toddler phase with a strong willed child. I know most are strong willed at this age but I'm taking extremely independent and strong willed people trapped in tiny bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "My son will be 2 in August. He has a feisty temperament in general and I would never describe him as easy going. I'm really struggling with him. Before I get into it, he is not cutting molars, he has no allergies, he is medically healthy, he is totally and completely fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're fully in the testing boundaries phase. We're also in the, no to everything and the running away. Oh God the running away. Never did I think I'd be a leash mom but literally he will run into oncoming traffic without one. He runs away from me every time I need him for a diaper change or tooth brushing. (This is tough because I like to chase him while we're playing but don't know how to draw a line between we're playing right now and other times we are not playing). He kicks me during diaper changes. He runs away if I do them standing up. I've tried getting creative with tooth brushing and different tactics work for a week or so and then we're back to I have to physically hold him down (dental hygiene is non negotiable and he literally has plaque on his canines because I can never get a good brush). He does NOT LISTEN nor does he care. He doesn't care about positive affirmations. He's gogogogo. So he doesn't have time to stop and think \"Oh wow that felt really nice that mommy told me how wonderfully I didn't throw my entire plate on the ground.\" Which brings me to the fact he STILL throws food and plates on the ground. I am sitting right next to him at every meal to stop his little arm from throwing and he does it anyway. Every single snack. Every single meal. He screams after every single bath no matter how gently I try to dry him. I often skip lotion because he hates it, but his skin is so dry. And he plays in the dirt far too often for me to skip baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have boundaries. I follow through with them. Example I will say \"time to take a bath, let's go look at your magnets!\" (Visual calendar) one time. If he comes, great. If not I go get him. Sometimes he lets me hold his hands and lead him. Most of the time he flops on the ground and I have to carry him. Choices do not work. \"Do you want to walk or do you want mommy to carry you?\" \"What shirt do you want?\" \"What book do you want?\" Is met with screaming and flailing. Other boundaries look like how I mentioned with the food. I tell him he's not allowed to throw and we're done if he does. And he still does it every single time. We're done with the meal at that point but he's still hungry. I put him back in the high chair and remind him of the rule. He will take two bites and then try to throw as soon as he thinks I'm not paying attention. I try getting him involved in activities (crafts, chores, cooking) and he just wants to destroy. I'm being serious. I try to show him how to paint, he's not slightly interested he just wants to throw paint brushes. I try to show him how to put spoons in the dishwasher, he throws himself on the ground because I touch his hand to help guide him. He has a learning tower that he absolutely screams when I go to grab it for him. But the thing is I KNOW he would enjoy being involved and learning but he just WILL NOT. He acts like I freaking beat him when I touch him and I've literally only ever been such a loving and gentle mom.\n",
      "\n",
      "His communication isn't great. He knows over 70 words but isn't putting two words together yet \"Want milk\" or \"Want snack\" but he does communicate. He LOVES my husband and my mom and is better behaved for them but he is still a hard child for them too. Daycare says he's well behaved. Please ideas about any of the behaviors listed above. Criticism of myself if needed. I'm so frustrated with him (and myself). Is any of this normal? My step daughter was NOT this difficult, but I met her closer to 3 years old and of course I wasn't in the parenting grind with her so it was different.\n",

      "So, my 21 month old girl has never been in daycare. She has swim class once a week with my aunt for a bit of socialization, but she’s always been home with us. At first dad and I worked opposite shifts, then I worked remote, more recently I was laid off and am embracing the SAHM thing with her for a bit while we regroup.\n",

      "\n",
      "It’s been a lot of swing and misses. We drop dad off at work (we share a vehicle to keep costs low) and try out a playground nearby. I’m an ADHD Type C mom… pretty laid back, honestly, but look a mess from the outside I guess, even if my kid is clean and cute and overall mostly well mannered for her age. Last few attempts to make friends at parks, we’ve run into some “snobby” moms who take one look at us and keep their distance. And it’s left me feeling pretty shitty, honestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like, idk. I thought leggings, no bra, and no makeup was pretty normalized for a toddler mom. It’s not like my kid is Pig Pen from Peanuts. She’s obviously well-cared for. I’m just not exactly made up to go to a park with her, y’know? I feel like that’s normal. But also I started to feel like it was affecting her opportunities to make friends and that fucking hurt, dude. Lots of crying driving home from our adventures.\n",

They were like magnets. Another kiddo their age showed up shortly after. The kids all got along great. The moms were in sweats with me, buns, no bras. It wasn’t awkward at all. We had a perfect triangulation of the jungle gym and were all cooperating 100% to watch and interact with all the kids and each other equally. It was PERFECT.\n",

He then started running around the island, when he came back around and was standing in front of me I opened my arms for a hug and he came barreling towards me and hugged me so tight.

      "My partner and I (in our 30s) welcomed our first baby four months ago, and I honestly think we’re doing pretty well - considering how tough it is, and how tough it could be. The pregnancy and birth were relatively smooth - not saying it was easy but  I’d say we went through the main common challenges without major complications - and I feel like I am recovering ok. I am still on maternity leave and my partner had a couple of weeks off at the beginning. The baby is exclusively bottle fed, which has allowed us to share feeding duties and alternate, in order to get some rest. We even managed to get some travels to visit family, meet friends for walks, drinks or dinners from time to time and this has been great too. Worth mentioning he has been an amazing partner so far and we’re so grateful. \n",

      "A few days ago, he told me he’s a bit struggling with the changes in our relationship dynamic - nothing major but he told me he felt that we’re not connecting as we used to (deep chats, intimacy etc) and his expectations for intimacy after four months were different and he’s having a hard time adjusting. I felt a bit confused considering how much harder it is for us women, both mentally and physically, and even if I appreciated his honesty I did feel a bit down. We’ve had sex throughout the pregnancy - much less frequently but still - until the very end (literally the same day before going to the hospital). We then tried again after a month/a month and a half and did feel great but quite uncomfortable still (even though midwife confirmed stitches healed well) and got better the couple of times after. I thought this was a pretty great pace for new parents but now he’s suggesting couple counseling. I can’t help but wonder, am I doing / are we doing something wrong or are we doing “so well” that counseling could be great sign to get better at managing future challenges too? I am a bit lost.

I had a rough recovery as well due to being scared of moving around too much and tearing a stitch. I do not plan on having a VBAC to reduce stress if it ending in surgery anyway. However, I am still scared. I’ve tried warming myself up to the fact I am due in a few months and have to give birth but the c section and recovery is killing me.

Luckily she's going to recover without needing stitches or other procedures but it was a long night and she was very upset and tired. After we checked in, I couldn't help but overhear the next patient check in with the intake nurse. She explained that her daughter had been having headaches for over a year and that they had just had an MRI. The MRI showed a large mass on her brain and they told them to go to the ER immediately. The mom was keeping so calm for her child but I imagine she was beyond terrified. Today they have a new reality to deal with. Who knows what it is. But I would not want to trade places with that mom. I'm sure she would want to trade places with me and have a kid with a swollen face taking a few days off school, and not a brain mass. If you have to wait a long time to be seen in the ER, remember why some other people are seen right away. You don't want to be the ones rushed back to see the doctor first. And a sleepless night and recovery at home are small things. They still suck, but they are small. I'm feeling grateful my baby is healthy and grateful to be the easy, straightforward case in the ER last night. \n",

      "For starters, my mom and I have a very superficial relationship. She is probably one of the most selfish people I know. Throughout my pregnancy she would make comments about her being in the delivery room when I gave birth and over and over again I told her no, it will only be my husband. My mom is the opposite of a calming, supportive presence and I guarantee she would make it about herself. So the week of my scheduled C-section (breech baby), she told me that my stepdad took off work the day of my section. When I asked why, she responded with “my baby is having surgery and I want to be there.” I again told her no I don’t want you there. She knew my mother in law was driving 3+ hours to watch our older, adopted daughter (that my mom wouldn’t help with). When she found out my MIL would be bringing our older daughter to meet the baby in the hospital, my mother made it clear she wants to be the first grandma to meet her.\n",

      "Two days later, my OB sends me to triage for high blood pressure and I’m told I’m having the baby that night. I told my husband that he could let my family know (mistake on my part). A few hours later, I get a text from my mom that she is at the hospital and just wanted to come give me a kiss before the surgery. I agree and she comes and tells me they are going to grab something to eat in town and to call her when baby is here. When walking to the OR, my husband tells me not to freak out but my mom/stepdad are waiting for me in the recovery room. At that moment I made the conscious decision to choose not to freak out and ruin the most special night. Surgery goes well and baby is brought to my recovery room with my husband while I’m stitched up. When I’m wheeled back to my room, my mom is there, holding my baby. Mind you, I haven’t held my baby yet. I was pretty drugged up and nauseas but I was upset. My mom makes a comment about wearing out her welcome and left shortly after.

      "\n",
      "I have been lying to my son about one of our dogs being put down. Back in February, one of our dogs bit our son in the face requiring 30+ stitches to his cheek and eye lid. Nothing major was damaged and he has been healing very well. The day after this happened I had that dog put down. The dog was my favorite dog out of the trio we have at home but has been aggressive towards children a few times prior to this. We also have a baby coming in July so with all of this the best course of action I could do was to have her put down. I feel terrible about this and has been one of the hardest things I have done so far in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The day i took our dog to be put down I came home and told our son that I had re homed her to a big farm that is very far away. For awhile he was asking about her and if we can send her things like a dog bed, treats etc.. It has not come to the point where he wants to go see her and I feel like maybe I should tell him the truth now that its not as fresh as it was back in February. \n",

Like, at all. All they do is go to church. They are there a minimum of five times a week. It doesn't matter how late it in the day it is, it doesn't matter if they are sick (they go with covid and don't believe in masks and have probably directly contributed to the deaths of some of their friends/church members), THEY WILL NOT MISS CHURCH. \n",

      "\n",
      "I'm struggling to figure out how upset I should be at daycare or if I should be at all. Long post incoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife, son, and I moved to the Midwest around 1.5 years ago. Our son had just turned 1 and we were starting to look for daycares. The best daycare in the area is at the university where I work. We miraculously got a spot and immediately signed up. It costs around $1,400 a month - it runs 7:30 am-5:30 pm and includes meals (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack). \n",
      "\n",
      "The first year was fantastic. Our son thrived in the toddler class. There were 8 kids with 2 full-time teachers and 4-6 student teachers at any given time (all of the student teachers are sophomores and up with degrees in nursing or early childhood education). We got updates through an app regularly throughout the day on bowel movements, how much he ate, how he napped, random photos, updates on his disposition, etc. They also gave up a class schedule a week in advance so we could see what the kids would be working on/learning and we could reciprocate at home. We met with his teachers every other month to talk about how he was doing (for 10-15 min) and had a bi-annual check in.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he graduated to the next class in July of 2024, we were excited. Everyone LOVED the teacher of the 2-3 year-old class saying she taught their kids how to be little people. It would be different, but a good different. Our experience has not been great.\n",
      "\n",
      "We knew the new teacher wouldn't be there when our son started - she was on maternity leave with her second child. Her associate teacher was filling in as primary during her 2-month absence. The associate, while sweet, did not know what she was doing. The transition meeting was a disaster as she didn't know what to do (we were the first parents she had to do a transition meeting with). The toddler teacher took over and walked us through what would probably be different. Mostly, more structure and less frequent updates. \n",
      "\n",
      "July and August were mostly fine. It took a turn in September. The new class teacher returned and all of the students except my son graduated to the pre-school classes together. Not a huge deal as all of his old classmates then joined him. However, the new teacher seemed pissed that we started when she wasn't there. She never talked to us about our son, about herself, about us, etc. We were kind of left in the dust. All other parents had 1-2-1 meetings with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "The associate abruptly announced she was leaving in late August. Her original departure was in November. They hired a new associate to shadow the departing associate. The departing associate then moved her timeline to the end of September and within a week of this change, just stopped showing up (apparently she texted the director saying I'm not coming back).\n",
      "\n",
      "The new associate was a trainwreck. The teacher was too busy with a new class, visiting her infant for feeds in a different classroom, etc. to train her appropriately. Oversight of the kids became a massive issue as more new kids joined the class. When there were about 10 kids in the class, it was chaos. Within a month, we had the following incidents occur:\n",
      "\n",
      "- My son was bitten by the same boy 3 times. The third time, no one saw it, we discovered a bite mark during bathtime and he told us XYZ bit me. I reported it to the director and she watched camera footage until she saw the incident occur. No one was watching them and when my son started crying and rubbing his shoulder, no one checked.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My son had 3 bleeding injuries that weren't reported via an incident report. I discovered one because he was wearing a different shirt than I dropped him off. When I grabbed the other shirt from his cubby, it had blood on the collar. Another time he was still actively bleeding from a scrape on his elbow that had a bloody band-aid on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My son leaned back in a chair and cracked his head open. No stitches or anything required, but it scared the shit out of me. I had strong words with the director after this as the teacher told me she saw him playing around with leaning in the chair but didn't stop him.\n",
      "\n",
      "- My son was punched in the face by a friend so hard his nose bled.\n",
      "\n",
      "I spoke to the director about oversight and she assured me this would be rectified as it was unacceptable. It was handled and we haven't had incidents like this since but we immediately began getting treated differently by the teachers in the room. My wife and I were either ignored/brushed away during drop off/pick up or overly pandered to (i.e., XYZ has been sniffling, he might be sick, maybe you should keep him home tomorrow). We're supposed to get a 3-5 minute debrief on our son's day (i.e., BMs/potty usage, how he ate, what he did, what his mood has been like, how he napped,) and we got nothing except 'he had a good day.' We felt ostracized.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was coupled with a severe lack of communication. We received one general update from the class most days (not every day) along with some photos (3-5). Our son was never in the photos or the videos (which seems nuts for a class of only 10 kids).\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of October, we were beginning to explore other daycare options in the area. At this time, the associate was terminated. There are a slew of reasons, but they all boil down to her being inexperienced and not receptive to training. The headteacher also announced she was leaving due to some health issues. My wife and I saw these changes as positive. A new teacher from another classroom was brought in as the full-time teacher for the class. We had met her before and thought she'd be a good fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "The new teacher has done well, but she's picking up the pieces of a shitty situation. She's on her own with just student teachers who can only do so much. Without an associate, communication is even worse. The new teacher's shift was drop off through snack, so we never saw her in the afternoon and the student teachers hadn't been there throughout the day so couldn't comment on how our son was doing. There were no class schedules, no photos, even more generic updates, etc. We felt like we were dropping our son off into an abyss - yes, we can observe at any point from a viewing room and I did a few times, but it's not feasible every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the holidays I spoke with some parents and they echoed all of the same sentiments. I'm fairly friendly with the director so decided to speak with her this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I articulated all of the above, some of which she'd heard before some she had not. I said at the very least, we need more communication and insight into what our kids are doing. As of right now, I couldn't tell you what they do every day outside of the brief 8-9 sentence describing their morning provocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told daily notes aren't feasible given the teacher's workload. She said parents are expected to allow 5 minutes during pick-up for a debrief. I noted that the main teacher isn't there during dropoff and no one knows the totality of a kid's day then. I also added that 2.5 year olds are fickle. If my son wants to go, we're leaving (i.e., he's crying for mommy or excited to see me and go home) - if that happens I get no update. It's a bad system. She's going to talk to the teacher about communication changes (such as sending notes if a debrief at pick-up isn't feasible) as well as rescheduling the teacher to be there for pick-up instead of drop-off. She also let me know a new, more experienced associate is on the cusp of being hired.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's another daycare nearby that's rated very highly (it's a bilingual French-English school). A friend teaches there and said she'd absolutely be able to get a spot for our son. Her daughter that's the same age transferred then when she turned 2.5 (the youngest they accept) and loves it. We'd also save around $500 a month for the same offerings (7:30-5:30 + meals). The education offerings aren't the same as at the university (i.e., the university has faculty from engineering, agriculture, etc. come visit and talk to kids and show cool stuff, as well as a veggie/fruit garden during the spring and summer, marching band visits, etc.). My son also has a lot of little friends at our current daycare and we're friendly with a lot of parents. The Pre-K class (6-7 months away) is now taught by one of the teachers from his former class who is so excited for him to be back in classroom (as are we). If we left, we likely wouldn't be able to come back because of their wait list.\n",

I have a 2.5 YO and a 1 YO, we really haven’t gone and done too many fun things with just us three (stay at home mom) because it still makes me nervous to go out with them without their dad with us for help. A mom group has recently formed and I decided to attend one of their outings today for the first time which was at a zoo where it’s set up on trails. Everything was going great, until after we pet the goats. At the end of the trail there was a (wild) ground hog that emerged out of the goat enclosure. My 2 year old walked up closer and it immediately jumped up and attacked his face. He has a bite mark and a few scratches. It all happened so fast I’m still trying to process everything. We immediately went to the ER where he got a rabies shot (and a few others coming up). He did great and thankfully didn’t need stitches. \n",

He's always been pretty impulsive. When he was about to turn 2, he ran to the kitchen to grab scissors and as I was running to him he literally cut his eyelid. (I called 911 ofc, we brought him to the ER and he had surgery to get stitches. he's fine now). I guess all I'm asking is, is it normal for a toddler to be so impulsive especially when upset? I'm thinking he's got to know what he's doing because otherwise he would actually bite his hand instead of acting like he is. But yesterday he had a glass bowl in his hand and when he slammed it it completely shattered all over. He's overall a pretty kid, just his reactions are so intense\n",

Back in October she was critically ill (two types of pneumonia diagnosed within 2 days of each other, bronchiolitis, collapsed lung) and we nearly lost her. I don’t remember her hr even being that high THEN but I was also more concerned with her oxygen then so it could very well have been. I did end up calling the triage nurse who said let’s wait an hour, give her Motrin and see if her HR slows down. It did (150s) so I felt comfortable treating her at home and just making her an appointment tomorrow. I’m extra cautious on illnesses now because she got very sick in February too, influenza led to bronchiolitis and super low oxygen again, like 88 at its lowest. \n",

But around 7pm she did this weird zoning out thing, it reminded me of when she decided to fight the tv stand when she was like a year old and needed stitches in her forehead. So I’m like nope let’s go now. Not messing around with that. Get to the ER and explain everything to the nurse, they got her finger monitor on and her pulse was definitely still high. Oxygen was perfect, temp was 101 (101.6 before we left the house). But then they check her throat and the nurse says ohhh boy. Her tonsils are swollen and patchy. So great, strep. However her strep test came back negative so they concluded it’s just some particularly nasty virus. They didn’t have much explanation on her zoning out, they were guessing she’s just really tired cause she’s been battling this fever all day. Makes sense and she hasn’t done it since.

I don’t know what happened, but my feet came out from under me and I went straight down on the edge of a stair and slid the rest of the way down. Still holding the baby, my cup, her bottle and my phone in my hands. I immediately felt intense pain and screamed. I was alone with her and my other kids, so I pulled myself up and dragged us to the rug at the very bottom. I was so scared I hurt her because she was terrified and wouldn’t let me cuddle her. She is fine, not a scratch on her. \n",

The whole time he’s on his way, she is absolutely freaking out and looking at me like she didn’t know who I was. I was in the floor when he walked in, he took me to the ER and I actually fractured my spine. While at the ER she is so upset even looking at me that he has to take her outside to calm her down. When I get discharged and join them, she’s freaking out again. She would not come to me at all. At 10pm she finally fell asleep on my husband, he had to transfer her to me after she fell asleep. At one point she woke up and saw it was me and got scared again. It’s 1am and she’s sleeping peacefully, I am out of work for the next two days so I can rest my body. I’m so worried she was affected by the fall, mentally. She always wants to cuddle with me, it worries me that she looked at me with such fear.\n",

      "I am a FTM to a 15 month old. I love him so much he is everything to me. He loves to explore he has been so mobile since 8 months he has been walking. He runs after me. I walk to another room and he follows me. He is super independent and I am so proud of him. But I have been very anxious since he has been born. I worried of him getting sick or getting hurt badly. I have these constant worries in the back of my head but still try and let him be independent and not too overbearing to make him scared to try anything. He has been great so far. He got sick and I handled it. I felt I was losing my anxiety. But yesterday we went to the splash park with his dad and we had a great time, afterward we played on the playground for a bit. His dad treats him older than what he is. I hate it but I get told I am \"doing too much\" but anytime he does something I tell him be careful or watch out, remember he is just a baby... Anyway, his dad decided to go down the slide with him (I had already warned him of what happens with he does that but he says he understands and he always makes sure his legs are safe) They go down this slide and low and behold my sons tiny leg gets stuck and bent. No cracking sound but my baby was smiling to shock and then crying. I tried to stay calm when I walked to him and picked him up and said let's see if he can walk, he could not. So I grab him and we go to the emergency room. His dad is acting like it is not a big deal, \"Oh he isn't even crying no tears are coming out\" just eating his chips driving no care in the world. He tries to make him walk again when we get there but baby was not having it. We go in and we check in and wait. He still is just saying how \"Oh it's probably just sore he can still move his feet and toes\" Just not taking it as a big deal. He gets x rayed and they say no signs of fractures or sprains but yet he might not be walking on it for a couple days. I worry that there is something wrong, I don't see how there can't be anything wrong if he can't walk? He took steps yesterday because his dad keeps saying he has to \"put pressure on it\" and I'm literally saying he needs to rest his leg and let it heal. I'm tired of how he treats him like this. \"He is a boy\" and he is also a baby! I am trying hard to understand this was an accident but it's hard when he acts like it is not a big deal. Our baby loves to run and walk and do everything on his own and now he tries to stand and he whines. I don't know what to do. I worried of this happening and now it has happened and I feel like I cannot stop crying to see him in pain. He is still happy and talking until he tries to walk.\n",

I had primary custody of the children until Nov/dec of that year when he went to court and said I was mentally unstable all because he had a text message from me saying I was overwhelmed and if he could take the kids for a few extra days. But that’s a long story. Once the kids were in his care full time he cut me off completely. No calls, texts, photos. Nothing…he lives in ND. I live in TX. Our kids are 15, 8, 18 months now. Our youngest was born fully deaf in the right ear and moderately in the left.)\n",

      "On may 14th my ex husband who has full custody of our 3 children sent me an email telling me our youngest daughter was in the ER because she had a seizure. I immediately started calling and texting him and he ignored all of it. I called the area hospitals they wouldn’t tell me anything. The next morning a case worker called me to inform me that the injuries my daughter suffered were caused from shaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma. She had a fractured skull, swelling, bleeding on the brain and retinal hemorrhages causing blindness. I immediately got in my car and drove 18 hours from TX to ND to be with her. The doctors told me that they didn’t expect her to live through the night. Luckily she did. She doesn’t require a breathing tube, only a G-tube for feeding so far. After many scans and tests I was told she didn’t have any other fractures but that there was evidence of older brain damage. Now we’ve been in the hospital 3 weeks, going on 4. And they are telling me she most likely will never be able to walk, talk, or do most things she did before. Currently she lays here, no movement, no nothing. She cries when she’s in pain or uncomfortable. That’s it. It’s like the lights are on but no one’s home. They say medically there’s nothing more to do. She just needs time. She will be transferred next week to a neurological facility in another state for a few weeks to see how she does. I’m trying so hard to stay positive for her but I’m so scared of the future. I love her and I’m going to do whatever I can to give her the best life possible. \n",

      "So me and my fiancé had a baby girl in January and I’m having a bit of issues with his parents. Throughout my pregnancy they would refer to me as “pregnant lady” or “pregnant one” and I HATED it as I’m my OWN person also invited ppl to come and touch my belly knowing full well I don’t like anyone touching me.\n",
      "When I had my baby girl I said  didn’t want visitors, unless I was up for it. I had my mom in the room and my fiancé (￼ important for later) \n",
      "I had a rough delivery I fractured my ribs my baby kicked me so hard when I was pushing, I had a epidural that almost killed me and she got stuck for while pushing. Back to the story \n",
      "So about 10 hours later after I had her she was born at 1am his parents asked to visit and I said yeah after I can shower and put clean clothes on.\n",
      "My fiancé was so excited to show our baby off to his parents as soon as they walked into the room he stands up to show them and his mom starts talking saying “your brother wanted to come” and my fiancé immediately says “no he sick!” And his dad FLIPPED started yelling at my fiancé, threatening ￼ vehicles, his car was in the shop and his truck took a shit 3 days prior. But then him mom was ganging up on him saying “he’s trying to be responsible by not coming” this brother of his is 22! It’s common knowledge I fear. \n",
      "Anywho, my poor fiancé sat down next to me and EVERYONE was quiet, I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed. I’m in the middle of the room confined to a bed holding a baby. ￼ then thankfully my mom texted me saying that she was at the hospital. They only allow two visitors max in the room so both of them had to leave so my mom could come up. ￼ then afterwards his mom texted him saying sorry for your dad’s behavior. His blood sugar was low. ￼ I don’t care how low his fucking blood was that was extremely disrespectful and uncalled for. He’s a grown man. ￼ They ruined that experience to show our baby off in her first couple hours. \n",
      "Me and my fiancé had already agreed that I’d be staying at my place with the baby. My entire room is set up for it and throughout my pregnancy that is what we were doing. His mom kept texting him saying when were we gonna move stuff over and they were gonna go drive to IKEA to get a bedframe and a bunch of other stuff His room is extremely small probably about the quarter size of my room he can barely fit a twin size bed in his bedroom.\n",
      "We currently aren’t living together due to his workplace being closer to his house so during the week he’s sleeps at his house, but he goes right from work to me, and I get him during the weekend. His parents were extremely upset with us because we chose to stay at my parents place,￼ as we actively look for a place of our own. There’s literally nothing not even an apartment to rent near his work. No, he won’t get another job because he’s getting a very amazing pay especially how everything is right now. We are extremely comfortable and then some. Plus, this is his career path and he went to school for this.\n",
      "They also would not stop bothering me when I was only one week postpartum when I would bring her over. Along with showing up at my parents house while my mother kindly watched my baby so I could get some sleep because I didn’t get any sleep in the hospital then got upset when my fiancé did not answer his phone because we were napping together and and his dad flipped out on my fiancé for not answering. Also texted my fiancé after I made a Facebook post, only tagging him, and my mom in photos that were took during the delivery with me and my mother and my fiancé because she was upset why she wasn’t tagged saying she was a grandparent too I told them that I only tagged my mother and him because they were the ones actively in the room and photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s get to the big part of the story, his parents continue to say things I don’t like disrespect me or my fiancé so I don’t like being around them. We don’t really go to his house often and when we do, I do not like when they hold her they argue too much. I don’t want her around that type of behavior. And she acts like I’m incompetent and I don’t know my child for example she’s going through this really big face where she only wants me and my fiancé is okay for about 10 to 20 minutes before she does not want him. They wanted to hold her, so I made sure she was fed burped and changed before I gave them to her then that way hopefully she would stay somewhat content because every time they’ve held her, she cried and was extremely upset and as soon as I handed her over, she started to scream and my baby barely cries And the first thing his mom jumps to is oh she must be gassy. Oh, she must be hungry does she need to be changed? And each response I said nope already did that. I come from a family of 13 kids. I am the oldest trust me when I tell you I know what I’m doing. She absolutely refuses to accept the fact that my baby’s going through a “I only want mommy ￼ phase” or the fact that she doesn’t really like her and I do understand that that’s most likely due to the fact that we aren’t around them and she doesn’t know them very well. But my skin CRAWLS when she holds my baby. she also always says MY baby or when she’s wearing a strawberry outfit MY strawberry shortcake. It’s always MY baby something.  And drives me nuts because has that checked she was not pregnant for 11 different months extremely morning sickness through the entire pregnancy. Almost ￼died during a delivery to have this amazing baby, then to claim it as her own is so weird. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I’m asking for advice is due to constantly hearing do you not like us and yesterday his older sister who lives with them, asked me if I had a problem with his parents since I never want to bring them around, and I don’t let them hold her. Or babysit and I’m not planning on letting them babysit. \n",
      "I’m sorry, but I do not trust that that man in that house will not have a tantrum and scream around my baby. My fiancé was abused by that man although he’s supposedly better since he went through therapy, I do not trust him. I watched him flip out because a box of batteries fell out from a bag and just fell on the floor. He has no regulation of emotions. ￼ and his mother constantly thinks she knows everything and is so much better than me. I will gladly take advice but when you are actively trying to tell me, I’m wrong with something. I don’t￼ like that, this is MY baby not yours. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the advice I’m asking for is, do I try to get over myself? Am I being a bit dramatic about the whole thing? Should I try to push past how I feel to let them bond with the baby?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, this doesn’t just have to do with how I feel but my fiancé said to me multiple times he doesn’t like our baby being around his parents because they’re almost always arguing and the random blowup that his dad has. he doesn’t even wanna be in his own house, let alone bringing his daughter into that house. \n",
      "They are constantly getting upset with my fiancé due to us, not bringing her around and it can be for any reason for an example if we have plans over the weekend and we are actively doing family things. She will ￼text her and saying “I guess we’re not seeing our grandbaby this weekend” \n",
      "\n",
      "There’s honestly so much more than I can keep going on about, on on why I do not want my baby there or really around them for some short examples. Their dogs have no manners and will jump up on you baby or not and they are big dogs. They have knocked us over a couple times while holding the baby. They are extreme hoarders. You can’t put anything on their countertops. There is absolutely no space. Hence the reason why they would never be able to babysit I will not let my baby be in that kind of environment. I know this is incredibly long already so I’m not gonna keep rambling but thank you so much for reading.\n",

      "Hi, I'm not sure where else to post this, but my 19 month old has stiffness in her right leg and especially her right heel. During her emergency c-section birth, the doctors broke her skull! She ended up with two parietal fractures on the left side, two brain bleeds, and it induced a seizure right after birth too. The doctor is referring her to \"rehab\" which is like a one time appointment to see if she needs braces or medicines. She's still not walking on her own yet and will only walk when holding onto something or my hand (not sure if its fear of letting go or if its due to the stiffness). I am very wary of medicines due to side effects and at her age she can't tell me if they are making her feel different. The doctor mentioned Baclofen and Botox. I asked if massaging her foot can help and she said yes. So my questions are:\n",

More “I don’t like you mommy” that’s sometimes followed with “I like you mommy” said in a way as if a switch has been flipped in her brain and she’s back on planet earth. More trying to fall asleep for 10 seconds and then losing it. I ask if anything is bothering her. More yelling at me. She can never answer the question no matter how i phrase it.

I ask her how I can help her and she screams at me. The screaming is just totally insane. It makes no sense and it seems like she’s gone crazy. I finally just lose my cool and yell “stop it!” Which I know I shouldn’t have but I just reached my limit. Now she’s really crying. \n",

Everybody says it’ll get better but it just hasn’t and it probably never will this school year. The teachers tell me she’s fine a minute later and I have a friend who is often dropping her kid off after me and always tells me that my daughter is fine when she gets there.

She keeps telling us all that she doesn’t like or love us and then she will take it back immediately after. Today, we removed her from the play area because she was being aggressive. \n",

He also since about 1.5-2 weeks ago has started trying to walk, so he has been pulling to stand about a month now. He is crazy, he’s my second boy my first is 2.5 now and he was much more chill, but I also could give him that 24/7 attention my second doesn’t get so he likes to explore and has gotten into trouble a few times. Just a little over a week ago, my 8 month old was standing up and using my toddlers little chair we got him to help support himself. We had gotten him a backpack that has a head support thing to help, but of course this time he wasn’t wearing it. Thankfully he had a winter hat on which I think really helped. Anyways, my 2 year old went over him and started playing with him and in my head I said “he is going to fall” so I started to get up and right as I did so he fell straight back and hit his head on the hard floor. My first had fallen out of our bed when he was a little younger and I had taken him to the ER, and they said as long as you know they are alert, didn’t lose consciousness and vomiting things like that then they are probably okay. So when he didn’t do any of these I thought he must be fine right? He cried immediately and only a couple minutes, there was not even a bump. Anyways, two days later I was breastfeeding him and I was rubbing his head and I felt a squishy bump on his head, and immediately panicked having anxiety and this being a head injury. Two ER trips later (they didn’t find anything the first time we went that night but we went again the following day because it had grown, and they didn’t find the skull fracture the first time because it was small and on his suture line of his head which just makes room when they’re babies for their brains to grow) turns out my sweet baby has a small skull fracture. WTF!!!! I only know stories like that when the parents are abusing them and they get arrested. I have NEVER heard of any people I know having babies with skull fractures yet they said it’s common at this age? Thankfully they said there isn’t any internal damage everything is on the outside of his skull nothing inside near his brain. I have cried so much and have felt so guilty. It’s been a little over a week now and the swelling has completely gone away, and they said it will just heal on its own but I can’t help but feel like the shittiest mother in the world. Everyone keeps saying stop blaming yourself but how can I not? It is my fault. It is my job to protect him. I feel like I am drowning in guilt. I wish I was there sooner. I should’ve been. I know better than this, and yet I thought “he will be okay he won’t fall” and didn’t get up until the last moment. I suck. \n",

      "27F, this is likely a pretty niche scenario but I've been in a mental spiral for weeks and could really use any advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was about 20 years old, I tore my ACL in a skiing accident. It was painful but I was still able to walk. MRI confirmed it was a complete tear and I did many months of PT. My family dr at the time recommended that, since I was not in pain and my knee was responding well to PT, not to do the surgery. As a 19/20 year old that was all I wanted to hear so I trusted his advice. In hindsight, I should have gotten a second opinion. Since then it hasn't given me much trouble, no real pain unless I hyper-extend it or twist it a weird way and if I did that, it was just sore for a few minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, on boxing day, I was getting out of the car on the passenger side, stepping onto my \"bad\" knee, and something snapped. I immediately couldn't bear any weight and was in excruciating pain. I went to the ER the next day, and they ruled out a fracture but suspected it was a meniscus tear. I went through some hoops with my family doctor and was eventually able to get in with an orthopedic surgeon this week. MRI confirmed I have a bucket handle tear of my medial meniscus. From our initial consult pre-MRI, he noted that if it was a bucket handle tear, I would need to for sure have surgery and do it ASAP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Normally, I would suck it up and deal with the surgery and lengthy recovery, but I am a new mom to an almost 3-month-old. It has been horrible the last 3 weeks since the injury, being unable to really take care of him and constantly needing someone around because I can't be alone with him. I can change him and nurse him, but he is a baby who needs to be walked around all the time and that is literally the one thing I can't do. The thought of undergoing surgery and being immobile for another 6+ weeks is terrifying and feeling like I am missing out on raising and caring for my baby is the worst thing that has ever happened to me (maybe it's the postpartum hormones talking). Not to mention, I am depleting my resources for help. My husband is not in a position to take more time off, my mom still works almost full time, and my mother-in-law doesn't work but has long-term injuries that make taking care of a big baby (he's already 15 lbs. at only 3 months) very challenging. I'm not sure how I am going to get through this recovery. \n",

He had 2-3 little red dots there so I got worried he was bitten by a spider. I sent pictures to our family and debated urgent care versus emergency.

      "I am fucking livid. I am a single SAHM and I am also disabled. I have Brittle Bones Disease and Osteoporosis. I had 3 vertebral compression fractures 10-15 years ago have suffered daily back pain ever since. I have days where I have horrendous muscle spasms and I struggle every single day looking after a 2.5 year old and a 15 year old on my own. I don’t get any help, I am absolutely exhausted and run into the ground. I am also a neat freak and keep on top of my housework, it’s not like I’m lazing around all day doing nothing! Granted some days I can’t but I will catch up as soon as physically possible, I continue to get everything done even whilst my back is burning in pain. When my toddler is sick he just will not sleep at night, literally he will stay up the entire night. He’s been sick almost constant since he started pre school in January. He hardly ever even had an illness before pre school. I assume his immune system is shit thanks to me cleaning so much, I dunno. But the lack of sleep since January had taken a massive toll on me, I feel so stressed, no patience, exhausted, not eating properly. Then a couple of weeks ago I got a kidney infection and went to A&E in agony. They gave me antibiotics and sent me home (first time I’ve not been hospitalised for a kidney infection. Win!) when I got home I was so poorly, my whole body was aching from the fever, the kidney pain was awful and all I wanted to do was get in bed but I couldn’t because I have kids to look after. If you’ve ever had a kidney infection you’ll know they are no joke. My mum and dad knew what was going on and left me to struggle on my own for the whole 10 days I was recovering. Not ONCE did anyone offer to help me. I even had to get my teenager a taxi to school because I was in too much pain to drive. A bath would have been so good but I couldn’t get a chance, every time my toddler was asleep I had to take advantage of that time to get sleep myself so I didn’t have a bath for over a week. \n",

I’m sorry but I am working, just in my home. A stay at home parents job never stops, it’s 24 hours a day/365 days a year and if you are single you never get a break. At least when my mum finishes work she can go home and just do what the fuck she wants and then go to bed and actually sleep! Her job has a start and finish time. Mine doesn’t. I hope this doesn’t offend anyone that works, it isn’t meant that way, I’m just fed up of some people thinking we aren’t allowed to be tired if we don’t work. I don’t go around telling people they can’t be tired if they don’t have kids! If I’m this pissed off about it, how do you all feel that are in an even harder position than me? I’ve only got 2 kids and one of them is not so little. I can’t imagine how you all manage with 3+ kids and no help? I know my situation is not as bad as some by far.

Now they kept it a secret for about three months and then we found out that they were dating.

But after my announcement, she began making comments. Basically just saying they were trying and that she had a feeling she was pregnant. I just ignored her. 2 months later, my brother-in-law invited us over one day & I knew exactly what they were gonna do. She hid in the bedroom and my brother-in-law said “I wanted to see the look on your face when I tell you this, but we’re pregnant.” \n",

      "I pretty much cut all contact .. I refused to be around them. I refuse to let them be around my child. It wasn’t until recently that I’ve allowed both our kids to have a relationship.

      "\n",
      "I stay home with our two children - a 3 year old and a 6 month old. Our 3 year old was restricted to no more than an hour a day prior to baby's arrival, but the screen has become a clutch of ours to use when baby is fussy and needs to be nursed and held. I would say he usually gets a couple hours a day now, typically in the afternoon when baby takes his long nap. We're usually out of the house in the mornings or do quiet time for the morning nap(s). \n",

      "\n",
      "Each time, my husband will typically take our toddler to his office so he can watch something while my husband plays a computer game. When he was younger, our toddler would sit on his lap and they'd more or less watch together, which I liked more because I know that's a better use of screen than just on their own. But these days, our toddler sits on his own (by his choice) and watches while my husband plays a game on his computer. \n",
      "\n",
      "If it was limited to once a day, or to an hour, I'd probably be OK with it. But it's not. And I let it go when we were in the immediate PP trenches. But we're in a fairly predictable routine and rhythm that I don't see it as necessary anymore.\n",

But they don't do that most of the time anymore. \n",

      "Our 3 year old acts crazy after any amount of screen, which is why I want to cut it out and see how things go. He very clearly gets overstimulated. It's better on the days he gets only 1-2 hours, but on the days my husband is home, he is absolutely wild. I see the correlation - my husband does not. He thinks it's just because he's home and has different energy. Could be part of it, but I believe it is more tied to the screen. And my husband gets so frustrated with our toddler on those days because he's bouncing off the walls and \"doesn't listen\". \n",

      "\n",
      "I need some outside perspective on this because my intuition is really flaring up, and I can’t shake how uncomfortable I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "I invited a friend over today for a playdate with her daughter. Our kids are both one, about two months apart. Honestly, the minute she got here, I regretted it. She spent almost the entire three hours comparing our kids and interrogating me about everything. For some quick backstory, we’ve been friends for over 15 years. At first, our friendship was great—we were the same age, came from the same culture, and even worked in the same department store. But over the years red flags started to pop up, and she began copying and mirroring my life choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as she arrived and saw the kids standing together, the first thing she said was that they were the same height, which she found “weird” because my son is two months older. They hadn’t even stepped inside yet, and that’s how the visit began. Throughout the afternoon she peppered me with nonstop questions: how much milk he drinks in a day, whether he’s still breastfeeding, how much I pump daily, what size diaper and Crocs he wears, what he eats for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, what time he goes to sleep, what time he wakes up, and how many teeth he has. She asked to see his toys and wanted to know which was his favorite. Then she went over to my baby bookcase, looked through all his books, and said she wanted recommendations so she could order the same ones. For months she’s been asking when I’m having a second baby, which I’ve always avoided answering, but she asked again during this visit. She also wanted to know what I planned to do with all my baby things and whether I would buy everything new for another child. She kept touching my son’s hair and commenting on how she didn’t expect it to be curly because my husband has straight hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point she stood staring at my gallery wall of 70+ family photos, almost like she was studying them. Later, I noticed she had left my medicine cabinet ajar, so I realized she had been snooping there too. She kept “testing” my son by asking him to count, say the ABCs, give her a high five, wave hello, and even stick out his tongue. Meanwhile, I wasn’t doing anything like that with her daughter—I just let her play. If her daughter said a word, I would repeat it and tell her good job, but my friend seemed intent on evaluating what skills my son had. While we were feeding him, she asked what kind of milk he was drinking and what juice was in his sippy cup. She even asked my husband what nicknames we use for him. He gave a vague answer, saying we have lots of silly ones, but she pressed further and said she had heard us use a couple and wanted to know what else.\n",
      "\n",

      "I need some advice. My daughter’s nighttime sleep is getting worse. As a newborn and up to a few months old she did the typical wake up a few times to eat and go back to sleep, we were assured she would drop the night feeds and sleep all night. She has slept through the night a handful of times. Typically she will wake up 1-3 times but for the last month and a half or so she’s waking up 4+ times. We have an 8 year old girl and a 6 year old autistic boy as well, we live in a 3 bedroom house so unfortunately the baby is in our room in her crib. We’re hoping to move into a 4 bedroom in January when our lease is up but until then she’s in our room which I know is a problem by itself. So I’ll use last night as an example, she didn’t nap well yesterday so she went to sleep at 8:15, and woke up crying at 9:15. I laid down around 11 and she woke up again at 12:30, I sometimes will take her to the recliner to feed her and put her back in her crib but if I have to work the next day I’ll sometimes just put her in my bed and I’ll sleep on my side and let her eat since I breastfeed. The night before was really bad as she was waking up every hour or 2. Some nights she only wakes up once or twice. She has 4 teeth and is cutting 2 more but she doesn’t seem to be in any pain and I don’t think she’s been teething the whole time her sleep has been fucked up. She crawls and can pull up to her knees. I’m looking for advice on what I can do to help her sleep longer consistently. I have tried to let her cry it out but after 20 minutes of her crying loudly I just get up to get her before she wakes up one of the other kids. I have also tried to make a bottle and put it in her crib next to her when I go to bed but she won’t drink it, I feel like that’s especially because she knows I’m in the bed across the room. I feel like I’ve created my own problem by feeding her every time she cries at night so now she wants it as comfort because there’s no way she’s hungry. She does eat solid food as well and her daytime nap is typically around 10:30am and can last between 45 minutes to 2.5 hours. I’m sure I’m not the only person who has had this problem so I’m hoping someone on here can offer advice. \n",

      "SAHM life is rough and I often find myself overstimulated and longing for a breath of fresh mountain air. We live in the desert near some mountain towns and it's so nice to visit those places, especially in the autumn when trees are breathtaking and the air is cool and clean. Fire season is often too hot for comfort, even in those gorgeous mountain communities where temps can be 15 degrees or more cooler than the desert below. I consider myself a simpl(er) woman. I long for the small, lovely things.  Good music, a drive to practically anywhere (I'm a lover of driving), quiet moments, gazing at wildlife and trees, you name it. Anyway, I'm just venting. After having our second baby this year (our first is 6 and ADHD) I've been so overstimulated and finding myself feeling suffocated. Our apartment is tiny, my husband is a LEO, my kids need me constantly, my mom's been dealing with dementia symptoms after developing MID, I feel cut off from others, I've just been dealing with a lot of different things all at once and I can't travel to my favorite places to just breathe (as I mentioned before the mountain towns are quite hot now and my all time favorite cliff-side lookout sustained major fire damage last year, completely wiping out the roads, seating, and the whole valley you look out to 😭). I say all that to tell my fellow mamas that I've started just walking out of the apartment into the patio and just staring at the trees, houses, etc nearby and breathing. Just for a couple minutes. Just to get the suffocating weight off. I've been playing calming \"ambience\" YouTube videos on TV during the day. Yesterday I picked up my kid's chalk and started drawing random lines and shapes. And it felt good. Today I sat down with my 6yr old and colored a page that I chose from her coloring book with seriousness and actual enjoyment. It's always the little things with me. But I'm finding that if I even do childish things, I feel better. Sometimes we just need to feel like a kid. Sometimes we just need to go back to the basics of life and enjoy something that seems silly. I encourage you to do something for YOU. And try something, anything, that helps you be a little more you 🥹\n",

      "We have a 2 month old and are fortunate that a family member who is also a teacher will be able to watch our LO until she returns to teaching in the fall. With this said, our girl will be closer to 6 months by the time she needs alternative care. When I was pregnant, I connected with a childhood friend whose mom runs an in-home daycare (and has for a few decades). She feels certain that she will have a spot in the fall as she has 1 kid starting preK then. She only watches 6 kids at a time and majority of them are ages 2+ so they don’t need as much hands on care so (in theory) this would allow for our LO to have more hands on care than she would if there were 4-5 other infants. Obviously, my husband and I knew we needed a backup plan should this not work out, so we had submitted an application for a spot at a local church daycare as a safety net. They have since struggled with staffing and have had to cut enrollment numbers so it’s possible they won’t even have availability for us then. Since being on maternity leave, I have scheduled 2 tours with the other ‘reputable’ places in our area and both were a major letdown. \n",

Financially, things would be much tighter but not impossible. Selfishly, I’m worried that it won’t be a positive situation for me as I find a lot of fulfillment in working and having a routine.

      "\n",
      "My husband and I are both in our late 30s, and in our home we have 12M, 4F, and two infants. My husband and I both grew up with unlimited screen time, but obviously things were different then. There was no streaming, and youtube only entered its infancy when we were in high school. I spent a lot of time on MSN, roleplay forums, and had a few TV shows I watched every week. I didn't really pick up gaming as a hobby until my mid-twenties, but I do my fair share of gaming these days when I can squeeze it in. My husband is a similar story, though he definitely does more gaming on a day-to-day basis. (For what it's worth, I do have many creative hobbies that the kids see me engage in.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "When 12M was younger, we had a rule that he didn't get screen time during the weekdays. Back then, he didn't have a phone or a tablet, so that really just meant he wasn't allowed to play video games. He could, however, absorb whatever my husband had going on on the TV. As 12M grew up, this evolved. Husband told him if he got good grades, he could play games during the week. Over the years, he's been gifted a tablet and a smart phone (no SIM card in it). We have FamilyLink installed, but frankly he's still getting far more screen time than I think is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "His grades have fallen—he's on the verge of failing both math and English. He's AuDHD (medicated ADHD and level 1 autism), and he's hitting his teen years so, unsurprisingly, he's developing a hell of an attitude. He sulks about chores he's given. He wants to quit Scouts, which a year ago he really enjoyed. He's started resenting the 'different rules' we have for his 4-year-old sister, which are largely different because *she is 4.* \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "His sister does get a fair bit of TV time, but this is either supervised Youtube Kids or childrens shows on Netflix.

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I'm in favour of severely cutting back on his screen time, but there's only so much sway I have given that 12M is my stepson. Husband has sole custody and he rarely sees his bio mom. I don't think the fact that we both game should have any bearing on how much 12M should get to do the same, let alone how much time he gets to spend on Youtube/Tiktok. I want to suggest eliminating screentime (except for peripheral TV watching) during the week, and severely limiting it on weekends, at least until his grades and attitude improve, but I think it'll be a hard sell for my husband. I'd love some opinions, especially from other parents who game and enjoy a lot of screen time themselves.\n",

It’s not malicious in intent, she simply isn’t mentally or financially stable enough to care for the three minors in her care. My partner and I bought a house recently and have been aiming for the goal of custody for three years now despite CPS intervention (on her, she has full custody as of now) there is a lot of back story but the long and short of it is that my partner and her had three kids back to back (she was supposedly on bc and my partner got a vasectomy at 23 after the last pregnancy) she had two infants prior that my partner raised as his own due to the fact he’s amazing and their bio dad was in prison. We welcome all the kids in our home equally and love them all immensely. Their mom struggles severely with mental health and finances. She inherited her house and has only taxes since she lives rurally with self sufficient means. Partner pays A LOT in child support to care for his kids and we pay her cell phone bill to make sure we have contact. We often give her gas money and grocery money and supply the kids with any extra expenses. She gained full custody due to her owning a house and my partner having a marijuana possession charge before it was legal. She has had cps intervene multiple times over the last 6 years including someone overdosing on meth in her home with the kids there and nothing was done. It’s important to note that she lives in rural Midwest where they prioritize a mother, despite her child endangerment charges. We even bailed her out.\n",

He is either locked in his room sleeping or off in a corner gaming with headphones. He doesn’t want to interact with anyone. He is so removed from everything that my partner and I took his gaming away for extended periods of time and tried doing out of house activities and socializing. He refuses to engage. At home with us, if he can’t game he is sleeping. He won’t do chores. There’s no encouragement, motivation or punishment to persuade him. He regularly says blunt and offensive things under the pretense of “well it’s true,” he regularly argues with everyone regardless of topic he takes opposing opinions often contradicting himself. His siblings are worried for him as well. He has no friends, shows interest in nothing and hates showing affection (I understand and relate to this so this issue is never forced. I don’t like physical affection from most people so I get it) I do everything I can to engage him. I seek to relate to him on his level and ask about the few things he enjoys (shows and games) sometimes I feel a connection but most often it’s shallow. He’s said some problematic things under the guise of joking but when confronted it didn’t feel like a joke. I’m worried for him, I love him so much and want to do what’s best for him. \n",

He’s been telling me how removed his brother is and how their mom is berating him for not forcing his brother to do chores and interact with school. I don’t like that at all. It’s not his responsibility to parent his brother, only encourage and help.\n",
      "My partner and I have our hands tied as of now since we only see them on weekends and in order to gain custody we have to air a lot of their moms dirty laundry (it’s a fucking lot. One example that PISSES ME OFF is that her bf who doesn’t contribute a dime to the house has a locked cabinet of food and snacks she purchased for him with stamps that kids aren’t allowed to touch even if all they have is beans and ramen). The other two minor children have made it clear they want to live with us but the last thing we want to do is badmouth their mom when we’ve made a point of never doing it. Going through court is going to be a mess but we want to help them thrive. Their mom has made it clear if they wanted to live with us she would cut them off for life. She guilts them when they want to spend their whole vacations with us. \n",

      "\n",
      "Hi! \n",
      "I'm having a lot of feelings. I think I've 95% made the decision to go back to work as a public school teacher in August. I've primarily been a SAHM since a bit before DD1 was born in February 2022. I did a short stint teaching PreK at her 9-12am preschool last year and really enjoyed it. I returned to 100% stay at home this year because  DD2 was due and born in October. She misses the \" 1 by September 30\" cut off for almost every true \"preschool\" type set up and would have to go into an infant classroom which are really only full time. DD1 needs 5 day preschool. She has some neurodivergency and her need for stimulation is HIGH and she needs all the friendship practice she can get. We can't really afford this if I don't work. \n",
      "\n",
      "She's currently only attending preschool two days a week for 2.5 hours each time. It's just not enough. Now that baby is here, she spends so much time watching TV because she would and has destroyed the house while I'm feeding or putting the baby to sleep for a nap. If she isn't destroyed the house she's grabbing or getting in the baby's face while she eats. She went from zero screen time to almost the whole day while dad is at work watching a screen. I feel so bad and I know this isn't going to work long term. We are all miserable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But I also feel bad at the idea of putting DD2, my will be 10 month old in M-F childcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost my entire teacher salary will be going to put them in school but I will be able to keep about 1000 a month to help with pay for the fun stuff. Right now, we are bare bones existence. Inflation has hit us hard. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are your experiences? How do I get past the guilt of mostly staying home with DD1 only to put DD2 in full time daycare 8 months earlier than DD1  started part time preschool \n",
      "\n",
      "I miss my job. I was so much better at my job as a teacher than I am a SAHM. I need structure and external motivation. Being at home has severely impacted my mental health. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hate being my husband's dependent. I want to be able to buy my $4 gas station lunch without guilt. I want to be able to buy my kids toys without snide comments from my husband. I want to be an adult and feel like I have a say in my life again. \n",

      "Post 375: Update to: “My toddler’s oxygen dropped to 86% in her sleep and we were told to wait it out” - we finally have answers\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple months ago I posted about my daughter’s oxygen dipping into the 80s while she was asleep. She had hMPV at the time and the ER treated it as croup, but nothing ever fully explained why her oxygen kept crashing when she looked totally calm. We got sent home with the usual “monitor and wait,” but I never fully let it go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week she had a scheduled tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for ongoing sleep-disordered breathing, congestion, and constant snoring. During surgery, her ENT scoped her airway and found three major things:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t•\tSevere laryngomalacia (the tissue above her vocal cords was collapsing into her airway)\n",
      "\t•\tModerate tracheomalacia (her windpipe is weak and soft, making it prone to collapse)\n",
      "\t•\tTonsils 4+, adenoids blocking 90% of her airway\n",
      "\n",
      "The surgeon told us her tonsils were some of the biggest they’d ever seen in a child her size.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also performed a supraglottoplasty during the surgery, a procedure that trims the floppy tissue above the vocal cords to open the airway and prevent it from collapsing during breathing. It’s the standard fix for laryngomalacia, done entirely through the mouth with no external cuts. Small procedure, huge difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this was congenital. She was born with it. And suddenly everything makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’s always been a noisy breather, even as a newborn. We were told it was normal. She didn’t turn blue or gasp, so no one thought much of it. But one night her Owlet gave us a red alert. Oxygen was below 80. She was completely still. We woke her up, she cried, and the numbers came back up. Her pediatrician dismissed it as a fluke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I really don’t think it was.\n",
      "\n",
      "We used the Snoo. We followed every safe sleep recommendation. We were textbook. And I still can’t stop thinking how close we might’ve come to something much worse—without ever knowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia aren’t direct causes of SIDS, but they are significant airway vulnerabilities. Add in massive tonsils, a virus, and deep sleep? The risk was real.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were discharged after just one night, and she’s already breathing quieter and has more energy. But I can’t stop thinking about the 22 months that passed before we knew. All that time she was working harder to breathe than we realized. And if something had happened in her sleep, we would’ve just… never known why.\n",
      "\n",
      "We feel incredibly lucky we caught this before something tragic happened. That one scope during surgery gave us the answers we didn’t even know to keep looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if your baby is a noisy breather, if something doesn’t sit right, if your gut says keep pushing, do it. Ask for the ENT referral. Ask for the scope. You don’t need dramatic symptoms to justify concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR:\n",
      "After months of breathing issues and a scary ER visit, surgery revealed our toddler’s tonsils were 4+ huge and her windpipe was collapsing from laryngomalacia and tracheomalacia. She had a supraglottoplasty and is already breathing better. We got to go home after one night and feel so lucky we caught it before something worse happened.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of infertility and IVF - including a bilateral salpingectomy because both of my tubes were filled with fluid - we were excited to finally be pregnant. But in my third trimester, I started spiraling. I felt trapped, scared and depressed. I even wished I could go back and not get pregnant. I was so ashamed to feel that way and just smiled and nodded whenever told me I must be so excited to meet my baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "My baby was breech, so a scheduled C-section was the plan. My OB assured me I’d be awake for it with an epidural after discussing my spina bifida at pretty much every appointment. But minutes before surgery, I was told that I’d have to go under general anesthesia. My husband couldn’t be there. I had no time to process anything and started panicking even more. I was incredibly scared. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the OR, just before they knocked me out, four providers pinned me down to forcibly place a catheter - without anesthesia, without consent. I was kicking, sobbing, panicking. It hurt so much and triggered old trauma from when I was raped as a teenager. I felt violated all over again.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I woke up, I was vomiting, in agonizing pain, and bleeding heavily. It felt like I had been cut in half. My postpartum hemorrhage was severe, and the pain was unbearable until they finally gave me a pain pump hours later. I was in and out of consciousness, vomiting and in pain… barely functioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I lay there, my OB performed a uterine compression massage ( for those of you who are lucky enough to not know what that is – it’s when your OB inserts his entire hand inside of your vagina and then compresses your uterus with his fist while pushing down on your lower abdomen with his other hand to make the bleeding stop)  without warning or consent - and it was one of the most painful, violating things I’ve ever experienced. In a video my husband took of our baby receiving her first bottle, you can hear my screams in the background. Neither me nor my husband were there for her birth or to hear her first cry and now I was missing her first meal. I didn’t even meet her until hours after her birth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later that day, in the family-centered care unit, a nurse told me she had never seen anyone come up from surgery in the shape I was in. I didn’t feel like a mom. I didn’t even remember that I had a baby - I just felt like I wanted to close my eyes and disappear. To make the pain go away. \n",

      "I tried to breastfeed the next day - it had been so important to me. But she wouldn’t latch. She’d already had bottles, and my supply was almost nonexistent, likely because of how much blood I’d lost. For the first month, I triple fed: nurse, bottle, pump, over and over, while dealing with a baby with severe reflux. I was deeply depressed, still dealing with physical and emotional recovery. I cried every day. I had PPD and PPA and had flashbacks to her birth several times a day. My husband helped as much as he could, but he had to go back to work after a few weeks, and I felt completely alone. No family around to help and all our friends worked and had busy lives themselves. \n",

      "It took me seven months, and finally quitting pumping, to even begin bonding with her. Very slowly, we got to know each other. I’m a postpartum doula, so I knew how to take care of a newborn - but no one teaches you how to bond with your child while navigating PTSD. For a long time, motherhood felt like a job I couldn’t quit - with no breaks, no pay, and no joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she’s 3, and the greatest gift of my life. She is fiery, funny, brilliant, and yes - completely exhausting. But we are so close now. She’s my little demon, and I wouldn’t trade her for the world.\n",

      "To all the moms who were not overcome with love when you held your baby for the first time… If you had a traumatic birth… if you didn’t fall in love at first sight… if it took time to connect… you’re not broken. You’re not alone. You’re still a great mother.\n",

      "My youngest has had an awful time with recurring/chronic ear infections. The first one happening in August and kept coming back following antibiotics. He got his first set of tubes in October right before his first birthday where we had to follow with oral antibiotics and drop constantly. Fast forward to the NYE he got the flu and his ears started draining constantly. We got in with our ent and it was thick mucus draining from his ears, so we get a new set of tubes and adenoidectomy at the start of this month (four months after the first set). I have cut dairy out which doesn’t seem to help with any congestion so I don’t think that’s the issue. Well today when I picked him up from daycare his ear seems to be draining again with the glue like stuff, which would be considered “glue ear” just looking for what other parents may have tried that has helped with constant ear drainage/ congestion because we are desperate. \n",

      "\n",
      "Did anyone reading this decide to let their kid self-wean and determine when they were ready to stop breastfeeding? I'm a very relaxed and tender person by nature and have tried to avoid putting pressure on my kid to grow up faster than strictly necessary. From birth, he's been very keen on breastfeeding and basically used me as a pacifier/comforter. He wouldn't take pacifiers or bottles, and doesn't have a favourite stuffed animal or blanket or anything like that despite encouraging it. Now he is 3.5 (!) and still not ready to give it up. He usually doesn't ask during the day, but still wants to breastfeed to sleep and pre-dawn will scream for me to come into his room, then writhe around breastfeeding in his sleep until he wakes up (during which time I of course get no sleep as I have a gangly 3 yo rolling around on me). He gets hysterical if I say no and if I talk about 'saying goodbye to boobie' down the line he gets very emotional and cries about still needing/wanting it. I've talked about having the boobie fairy bring him an amazing gift once he stops, or throwing a big party with all his friends to celebrate the next step in becoming a 'big boy' (he's very sociable and loves the idea of having parties), but he continues to blubber and says 'I don't want it!' Like I said, I never wanted to be harsh and cut him off cold turkey - every resource that advocates for allowing kids to wean in their own time said he'd let me know when he was ready - but I'm starting to wonder if that day will ever come haha. Please no nasty comments, I get that breastfeeding into toddlerhood can be seen as perverse but it's clearly his 'happy / safe place' of which I never wanted to forcibly deprive him. To be fair, when I made the decision to let him decide, I thought he'd be around 2 and not 4! It's honestly hard to find information about longer-term breastfeeding online, so I'm just looking for any lived experience I can gain some insight from - specifically, if it's gone on this long, will he eventually decide he's ready to stop on his own or will I have to cut him off? Does anyone have any advice to help bring him around?\n",

      "\n",
      "My daughter is 2.5 and lately is having a really hard time when we turn off the tv. The only screen time she gets is on the tv (with the occasional cartoon on my phone at a restaurant.) She will watch either Little Bear or Doc Mcstuffins or sometimes we watch a family movie all together. She has a full blown meltdown everytime it comes to an end. Sometimes affecting the rest of the day. No matter how many times we warn her last episode or how long we let her watch. Today felt like my last straw with her and screens. Her 2.5 yo cousin was over while my mom watched her for me. I got home and my mom was playing tv for them. When her cousin came to say bye to her while she was still watching she screamed “MOVE!!!” In his face and he ran away crying. That’s not like her and I don’t like feeling like she’s becoming addicted to something and cannot control herself. I have a hard time controlling g my screen time at 27 so I can’t imagine how hard it must be for her. I try to model healthy screen habits by not having social media , containing Reddit etc to while she naps, and very rarely watching my own tv in front of her. I don’t let her watch too much tv and sometimes she’ll go a day or two without screens at all. I think because she doesn’t get it too often, when I do play it for her she is glued to it because she knows it’s not all the time. I’m not willing to let her watch more than she is and I don’t like what it’s doing to her when she has it limited. So my next option would be to cut it all together until she’s a bit older. Is this extreme? How would you go about having this conversation with her when she inevitably asks for a show? Thank you!\n",

      "Long story short: met and started dating my now ex husband in 2014. He had a 4 yo son with HCBM, ex in-laws were heavily involved in a continued friendship with BM. We married 2016, son born 2017, daughter born 2019 and divorced 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose to divorce my husband due to his alcoholism. Myself and my children had no quality of life and I was tired of them watching their dad slowly kill himself. He refused to get help, his parents refused to see he had a problem, and I was sick of being the doormat and free babysitter for ex husband and HCBM. She made the last 8 years of my life a living hell, and I was extremely happy to leave it all behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "I sold my house, and moved to an apt with my 2 kids. HCBM kept contacting me during this time, claiming she wanted the kids to maintain sibling relationships. She was adamant that she had court orders removing all custody from my ex husband, so she said SS could not see his siblings during visitation with their dad. I wound up blocking her and SS both after she claimed I was a terrible mother for allowing a court ordered step up plan for my ex husband to work towards sobriety and seeing his children. I also blocked the in laws for their continued relationship with HCBM and fishing for information from me. Ex husband was in a treatment facility at this time, was working on sobriety and therapy. He also wound up cutting off his family after therapy helped him realize how toxic, abusive and neglectful his childhood was. We now have 50/50 and my kids are doing great with both their parents in their lives. \n",

      "FF to summer 2024, and I randomly run into HCBM. She tells me that SS really misses his siblings and would like to see them. She finds me on Facebook and messages me a few times there too. What I need advice on is how to tell her that I would not be interested in letting the kids see each other. The only reason I want to say anything at all is I’m quite certain she is going to try to use the messages someday to show her son that I wouldn’t allow my kids to see their brother, and I don’t want my SS to feel like he did anything wrong. She is manipulative and a liar. I have kept the entirety of 8 years of dealing with her in screenshots in an email he’s welcome to have when he’s old enough. I personally feel like he is going to grow to resent his parents, and will eventually reach out to me. I don’t want him to think that he wasn’t good enough to have a father, but his siblings were. The ONLY difference is literally his mother and her unwillingness to cooperate his entire childhood. I want him to know he was always worthy of love and he did nothing wrong, but I also want to have proof for MY children that it was never their fault either. What’s a “professional” way to handle this, if that makes sense? SS is 15 now, and I feel it won’t be long. \n",

The eldest did (after some back and forth), and I decided I can help the youngest do that later. I then asked them to pick up the toys they left in the living room. The youngest said no, and the eldest said it was her sister who brought them there (she did have a point). I started talking to my youngest, she ignored me, I started raising my voice.\n",

I shouted even louder, now both were afraid and the youngest started crying. At this point I got a hold of myself, stopped raging and apologised. We talked, I apologised again and they seem fine.\n",

She is at a camp that is for 3-4 year olds because that was how the age cut-off worked. We had concerns about her being one of the oldest kids because she's very bright and can get unruly if she's not challenged. She never had issues in preschool because we feel she was adequately stimulated. But this week.... omg..... she is in trouble at camp ALL. THE. TIME. And now I feel like the counselor (who is a college student) just doesn't like her and has it in for her. I don't want to be THAT parent, so I've been holding my daughter accountable for her behavior, she's had no screen time, etc. But today my husband and I decided to switch her to a different camp next week where she'll be with 4's/5's. I'm just feeling a little stressed out and defeated - mostly fearful about the future and how teachers will like her (or not like her) and how that will impact her. Anyway... just stressing out loud here. Has anyone dealt with this, with bright kids who need a lot of structure/stimulation being straight up DISLIKED by a teacher? How do you deal with that?   \n",

She told me that we should stop going places like the library or playgroups altogether because the kids get sick from the cold and spent the entire visit worried about my son taking off his socks or my daughter not wanting to wear a long sleeve shirt. She also cried multiple times during the visit after hearing my daughter coughing because she's sick. I tried explaining to her multiple times that is not how the kids get sick and that this sick season has been awful for everyone in our area. Then I asked her to stop making the comments altogether. She also made them to my husband when I went to rest and when he pushed back she said that he can't talk to her like that. He has been trying to keep me low stress since I am due in a week so he didn't mention it untip after they left. After the visit my 3 yo daughter asked if I was going to cry like grandma. We have already gone very low contact with my mom due to other inappropriate behavior and I don't want to cut her out completely but I don't know how to proceed.

My question that I didn't think to ask before leaving is the bottle the problem or is it the milk after brushing the teeth?

I went back in there and gave him 2 oz more in the bottle and he went right to sleep. For his nap today I put his milk in a sippy cup, let him finish it, and then gave him 2 oz of water out of the bottle while he's laying down and he did well with that. Obviously bedtime will include brushing teeth prior to the bottle. Is this okay or is it the bottle that's the problem? I know leaving the bottle in there for him to suck on could cause bottle rot but we take it with us before leaving the nursery. \n",

      "Basically what the title says, but I'll give more context:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "My husband (31M) and I (29F) have two sons, a nearly 3 year old and an 8 month old and we own our own house, a 1680 sqft, 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, two story house. The only things upstairs are the master bedroom, the one full bathroom, and the two smaller \"kid\" bedrooms. One of these rooms is currently being used as a nursery and the other is being used as storage and as an emergency guest room as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, my husband's oldest sister (23F) went off to college and, with two children still living at home, my husband's parents sold their house and bought a new one with fewer bedrooms. This meant when the older of the two girls came home on holidays, the college girl was basically forced to keep her clothes in her suitcase and sleep on a rollaway cot in the youngest girl's room. This caused a lot of tension and issues between them. Fast forward to now and all three of my husband's siblings (28M, 23F, 18F) have been a revolving door moving in and out over the last few years, but the final configuration this coming fall will be 28M and 23F occupying the two available bedrooms at my inlaws' house while 18F moves off about 5 hours away to go to college. The current plan for when 18F comes home on holidays is for her to do what her sister did, which is basically live out of her suitcase and sleep on a rollaway cot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we didn't have our house when the oldest sister was going to college and, to be frank, the sale of the old home and purchase of the new home made her parents thousands which they then used to pay for her private school college tuition. So we didn't have the room to keep her in the first place and even though she was sleeping on a rollaway cot, she still benefitted by getting a good chunk of change towards her education free and without strings attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 18 year old gets no such consideration. She gets no money for school from her parents and her two adult siblings, one of whom is finishing their masters degree, get their own bedrooms to store their belongings and their own real beds to sleep in. It makes me sick, honestly, but that's a post for another day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crux of the matter is this- 18F has already approached us and asked if she can take our spare room when she's home on the holidays. My husband and I 100% want to do this for her, and we all love each other a lot and get along really well in general, but I feel that in order to make things smooth we need rules and boundaries. So, I'd like advice on what I've come up with so far so I can present some ideas to my husband. Please let me know what y'all think:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "NON NEGOTIABLE RULES\n",
      "\n",
      "1. No matter what time of day or night, if she is in trouble or impaired and needs us to pick her up, she needs to CALL US. Choosing to drive home impaired is grounds for getting kicked out and sent back to her parents' house, and she can explain to them why. (I don't think this has ever been an issue or ever WILL be an issue, but I just want it said so there's no confusion on how I feel on the matter)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. We have full and final say over who she brings over and when they come over (we know most of her friends and like them and we're not ogres! we want her to be able to have fun and have friends over, this is more like, if she's being a dumb inconsiderate teenager and its midnight and she has a friend over and they're loud and my husband has to work in the morning and I need to tell them to cut it out or leave lol)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. No touching the thermostat (this may seem silly, but our old home really holds onto heat and I have to watch our electric bill like a hawk haha)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. My MIL and FIL will supply air conditioning of some sort for that room (our house is old and doesn't circulate the air well, it was in our long term plans to eventually get a window unit for that room, but if she's going to live in there full time the room needs a unit NOW haha)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. No smoke in front of kids and not upstairs (we are 420 friendly... no judgement to her or anything, but no smoke in front of the kids and not upstairs near the bedrooms. downstairs away from the kids or outside is what I'd like, and this isn't a rule we don't already follow ourselves...)\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If we're leaving the boys with a set of grandparents for the night so we can go out and have a date night and some time for ourselves, gtfo and find somewhere else to stay that night (she would have PLENTY of advance notice of a date night 🤣)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "FLEXIBLE RULES\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Contribute towards grocery bill? (she will likely be working)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Share location so we know where she is/text and let us know what's going on (this is really just for peace of mind and as a sisterly thing, not a \"parenting\" thing- if its 3 in the morning and we haven't heard from her, we just want to know she's OK, you know? 🤷‍♀️)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Her laundry is her laundry, we don't expect her to do ours at all but sometimes we may, if she's OK with it, grab some of her stuff and throw it in with ours to make a full load or whatever and she can do the same with our clothes too- I'd rather we all grab some of each others' laundry every once in a while to run a full load than running half loads all the time 😅\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Cook one dinner a week? (Again, this isn't something we don't already do ourselves, my husband and I both have a rule that we both cook dinner for the whole family at least once a week and preferably enough to have one night of leftovers)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you in advance if you read all of this and thank you as well if you give advice/suggestions. I'm trying to remember what it was like to be an 18 year old in college and want a little freedom while also maintaining some structure and boundaries to our home and I know that can be a tough needle to thread ❤️\n",

      "So my 18 month old has never slept well, she’s never slept through the night. It got worse around 12 months when we stopped formula because she would want to drink water all night (you can read my previous post on this). Anyway, it was habitual drinking and the past few weeks I’ve cut this out - she’s drinking less at night. \n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is it didn’t make a damn difference to her sleep. She wakes up crying but doesn’t even want the water. I eventually soothe her but it’s so frequent I don’t understand why she needs soothing every hour. Some nights she has what I think are nightmares or night terrors.. she basically cry’s and is inconsolable, it’s actually quite scary. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it doesn’t end there. The past month she won’t even fall asleep which she’s usually pretty good at. I try reading a book, having a bath, singing, but she does not want to fall asleep until she can’t even hold herself up. Her naps haven’t changed at all, I think this is in connection with her learning to walk the past month. \n",

I feel like they are in for a very hard road because we are not a wealthy family. Every support system in the US is collapsing. College is expensive (we are paying via Parent Plus loans which we will probably never pay back before we die) and it still doesn't guarantee that you will be able to find a job. I had them when I was 22 and 24. I was a naive child and full of optimism in the era of Obama. I feel so foolish for expecting things to continue to progress. They are 18 and 19 now. They work so hard but I feel like they might never be able to move out and have the life they desire and deserve. \n",

      "I'm not saying it was easy in the past. My childhood was hell. I ended up in a group home. I was in my own apartment by 17 (emancipated). I was determined to make sure my kids had a better life than I did. Things are supposed to improve and progress in the world, not get exponentially harder. I survived off a minimum wage job in 2000. My rent was only $300 a month for a 1 bedroom apartment. That same apartment now goes for $1100 a month. I feel like they are going to be stuck at home forever when all they want is their independence (even though we fully support them staying home as long as they need to). But their options are limited or nonexistent. The skills that they worked so hard at and are interested in are not really marketable for work. My daughter wants to be a writer and editor and my son wants to be a journalist. But their career paths are really uncertain and I feel like their just end up working retail with a degree they can't really sell to employers. Even if I had encouraged them to go into CS, those jobs are being cut by the thousands and no one is hiring. Kids should be able to have careers that they want, not force themselves into miserable careers that they aren't suited for.\n",

He has been chronically constipated since turning a year old and we have cut milk completely. He refused to drink it out of anything besides a bottle. However, he loves cheese. Even if he does not have any dairy he is constipated. The pediatrician just says to keep him on Miralax. I just weighed him and he still only weighs 19.8 lbs. He eats 3 meals a day and 3 or more snacks a day. I do think he has slightly grown in length. I’m worried about this next appt. Additionally, around 15 months old he would practice standing unassisted and then abruptly stopped and refuses to stand without holding onto something. He is not walking. He can walk holding our hands but the minute you try to switch to only holding one hand he drops to his knees. He does cruise along furniture all day. I don’t know if it’s more of a confidence issue or what. I’m just extremely stressed and worried that something is wrong or that there is something I need to be doing.\n",

Her mom has struggled with alcohol addiction and poor choices, and although my husband has always tried to stay involved, their relationship has been rocky. She even blocked him for several months recently, and we had no way of contacting her, or no way of understanding why or what was going on. \n",

It’s like a countdown to when I stop breastfeeding him that they will start keeping him. I hate the thought. I don’t trust them with his mental or physical well being for many reasons. I have voiced these reasons with my husband but it has turned into a heated discussion that results in calling me controlling and saying his family doesn’t matter. His dad is a horrible example (cheats, hyper sexual, drinks, smokes, curses a lot, etc) and his mother has zero common sense. MIL also refused to call him by his name until recently after I showed my dismay about it while also showing up unannounced and argumentative on things regarding my son. Last year while I was pregnant I cut SIL off after she began to talk a lot of crap about me to all members of the family about every tiny thing…all the way down to my nursery furniture. It’s very clear she hates me and I have yet to figure out why. I’ve been told jealousy (usually don’t agree with this but I do in this situation) - so I don’t trust her near me or my son. She has created a ton of lies and tries to get the rest of the family to believe her and be at odds with me, I guess? It’s bizarre. If my son goes to my in-laws she will make a b-line to go over there and I know they’ll allow it. I do not trust them. It is going to cause problems but I am having a hard time caring.

You hear all about gentle parenting and approaching your child with a calming presence and not raising your voice etc….that all sounds great, and I’d say most of the time I capable of it, but recently I just want to scream at them. They’re little and a baby, I get that. But sometimes when I calmly say “no / that is not a toy” and remove their hand from the charging battery, or from grabbing plants etc. they will look at me and do it a million times again. I want to scream. The times that I have raised my voice, my LO has reacted by either laughing and thinking it’s a game, or crying. Then I feel like a bad mom. I know parenthood is a test in patience within itself, but I get so frustrated sometimes. I am terrified my LO is going to be a toddler that throws tantrums which will not only be embarrassing but defeating. I know it’s only a “what if” right now, but I can’t help but to think of that potential. And frankly it scares me. Idk if I’m built for this.

      "I have a sweet 15 month old son who’s been almost EBF since the day he was born, and he hardly ever took a bottle until he was about 9 months old. The only time he truly was bottle fed since then was when he would go to my in-laws for the day because I had formula that was never used when he was a baby and I don’t yield much milk when pumping. He love love loves breastfeeding. Recently he’s been laying his head on me while nursing and also asks for comfort nursing frequently throughout the day. He’s preferred it over water and even cow’s milk, and would drink those from his cups sparingly in comparison to nursing. I breastfed him every morning at wake-up, before his nap midday, and before bedtime. He’s also been eating solids 3x a day and snacks throughout. \n",

      "My in-laws have always thought it was sweet and cute when he nurses and never made comments about me not covering up. I never have been shy about not using a cover, whether at home or in public. They’ve never had a problem with it, but I feel like that’s changing. My LO sits in koala position, and now needs both breasts out and keeps going back and forth, so now I’m more exposed and also my son has started playing with them between nursing. He will not tolerate a cover now. I can tell my in-laws are not as positive about him nursing anymore. Now he’s cutting a lot of teeth at once, and my mother-in-law kept saying directly to my son “one you have your teeth, mommy will have to stop feeding you! All it takes is one bite!”. One time is whatever, but she kept saying every single time I fed him until I said something about it because it was starting to really irritate me and made me feel like it’s like she wanted me to stop soon. My father-in-law also recently asked how long babies typically breastfeed for, but I’m not sure if it’s legit curiosity or just him thinking he’s too old for it already. My family have been so supportive of me still breastfeeding and it feels like the opposite now from my mother-in law since he turned one.\n",

I’ve been pretty stressed lately and I let it out then, and I’m normally gentle but firm and explain things when he does something he shouldn’t. He cried so hard and it broke my heart because even after I settled him and comforted him, he’s been refusing to nurse. \n",

He’d ask for “boob boob boob” as he usually did but once he’d see my breasts he looks like he’s so unsure and would try to reach for other things around us to play with. When he does get brave to try to latch, he just gently bites and goes “ouch” and looks at me to gauge my reaction. He also has been giving me big hugs and will rest on me like he did before. It almost feels like he’s both sorry and scared to try to breastfeed again. \n",
      "\n",
      "My mother-in-law was over yesterday to help watch him while I did things around the house. When I was attempting to get him to nurse again in his room for about 10 minutes, my mother-in-law ran into the room with his walker and was hastily saying “come let’s go walk! Show grandma how you walk!”. I thought that was so rude to interrupt my nursing session like that. The worst part is that I didn’t want her to think “I told you so” about the biting comment she kept saying before, so I never mentioned the nursing strike to her and how I was attempting to repair that relationship with my LO.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m so sad. He loved breastfeeding so much and still isn’t really drinking all his milk from his cups to at least replace the breast milk. I also feel like I took away his ultimate comfort and I feel so guilty. I’ve been on and off about when to wean but I’ve also been loving the bond and he didn’t seem ready to stop either. It’s so abrupt to stop this way if he does just end up never nursing again. I don’t know how to feel about this, between the strike and my mother-in-laws comments and actions.\n",

Has anyone else experienced this? My husband said it’s because he’s a tiny preemie or just cold but comparing to when he was younger, it looks different. I can’t google without fear of being on a part of the internet I don’t care to be but I have no frame of reference. My mom keeps him a lot so I asked her if she noticed it and she agreed with me that it’s changed. \n",

      "Post 419: I have an adult son living at home with no job, life or prospects. What should I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a 26 year old DS who lives at home with me. He has a diagnosis of Aspergers (now known in the medical community as autism spectrum disorder), which he received when he was 18. There were signs that something wasn't right going back to when he was a child, although no one involved with DS at the time (teachers at school) seemed to suspect autism as a possibility. I didn't know what autism or Aspergers was at the time, and I don't think there was as much awareness of it compared to now. I will try to describe what his current state of mind appears to be and what his daily routine is. He has a number of issues relating to social interaction, and some sensory issues which are centered around sensitivity to smells and bright lights. He has to have the blinds or curtains closed when he's in a room because he hates sunlight. He gets agitated by what most people would consider to be normal household smells. He very rarely leaves the house and will only go to places that are within walking distance. He doesn't drive and won't use public transport. He will only go to shops that have automated self-service checkouts because he doesn't like talking to employees at the regular checkouts. He also hasn't been to a hairdresser (barbershop) for a haircut since he was a child. I have to cut his hair for him. I don't like doing it and he doesn't like me doing it. He has said if I didn't do it he would just shave it off. He won't go to a hairdresser to get a haircut because he does not like having social interaction with people he doesn't know. I would say there are a number of unwritten rules of social interaction that neurotypical people just seem to inherently know, but he doesn't. These include knowing when it's his turn to speak and knowing when other people have finished talking, how close to stand to someone when talking to them, and just generally knowing how to talk to people without seeming awkward. Unfortunately he struggles in each of those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "He doesn’t work and has never actually had a job. He is usually up all night playing games and sleeps during the day. He has paid lip service to the idea of finding a job, but does not seem to have any plan regarding entering the world of work. I can't force anyone to give him a job, but he's shown no ability to get one of his own volition. He has no specific work-related qualifications or experience. To get a job you need some combination of qualifications, experience and references. He has none of those, but you need at least twonof them to have any chance of getting a job. Ideally you need all three. That includes minimum-wage jobs. That's how it is in the UK, and I assume it's also the case in most other first-world countries. He also has no friends or acquaintances, and has virtually no interaction with anyone except me for months at a time. Other family members have essentially forgotten that DS exists. No one ever asks about him or what he’s doing. They stopped asking a while ago. He does not get invited to social events like weddings and parties. He has also never had a girlfriend. I can’t imagine any woman giving him the time of day because of the way he is. I unfortunately have no other children and I have reluctantly accepted that I will never have any grandchildren. If he somehow obtained a job that requires teamwork and communication with the people you're working alongside, as a lot of jobs do, I honestly think he would end up getting sacked or quitting on the first day. It wouldn't surprise me at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a practical level, it's difficult having two adults in a house where only one is earning any money. He doesn't claim any benefits and has no other income source, so I'm having to prop him up financially. I have not been able to have a holiday for over 10 years as I don't think DS would cope at home on his own for a prolonged period. He can do the bare basics like getting washed and dressed and preparing food for himself, but if there is a problem that he can't sort out himself, then he will just capitulate. When events happen unexpectedly or there is a sudden change of plans, which most people just take in their stride and deal with, he can't manage. I believe most people have coping mechanisms when they are in difficult or challenging situations, but unfortunately he doesn't. That's been an issue since he was a kid. If there was a problem with something in the house - for example if the fridge or the boiler wasn't working, or there was a power cut - he would just be a headless chicken and wouldn't be able to cope. I have tried to convince myself that it could be worse and that I should just accept the situation for what it is. I tell myself that if he was going out getting into trouble with police, doing drugs etc, it could be a lot worse. I know deep down that just because things could be worse doesn't mean it's fine and normal for a 26-year-old to be unoccupied 24 hours a day, and having basically no interaction with anyone in the real world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation has been ongoing for several years now. I don't want to throw him out but I am finding the situation increasingly difficult to maintain. I love him very much but I really need a break. It would be nice to have a holiday for a week and not have to worry about him the whole time. Unfortunately that's what I would be doing if I went on a holiday. I have some questions I would like to ask of other parents, particularly those with older kids (teens and adult kids). When you analyse the situation here, where do you think the blame lies? Is it my fault for enabling him? The issue I have with that is, as I mentioned, I can't force anyone to give him a job, but he doesn't have the life skills required to move out or get a job himself. Also I wanted to mention I am in England in the UK. I know it's hard to give specific advice since I am in a different country to most people here (I know Reddit has mostly American users). What would you do in my situation after taking all of that into consideration?\n",

      "I (43 F) am struggling alongside my (11 F) child as she does virtual schooling. She stopped going to public school recently as she had severe overwhelm and anxiety, and it was really affecting her mental health. Between the active shooter drills, bullying, constant noise and distractions, etc, she just could not thrive in that environment. So we signed her up to do her schooling from home through the district's virtual program (meaning it follows the district's curriculum and there are real teachers available to help if needed) to see if that would help her focus more and succeed. Well, it isn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter has ADHD which we are in the process of getting treatment for. I also have ADHD and vividly remember my experiences in public school as I was growing up... and it was pretty awful. My grades were terrible because many of the classes that I was required to take were not interesting to me in the slightest, and I could not concentrate or will myself to care no matter how hard I tried. I knew that if I didn't do the work, I would fail. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't graduate. It didn't matter. I just couldn't do it. The things I excelled at were the things I was interested in: English, Creative Writing, Art, and Music. Everything else were Ds and Fs and it made me feel incredibly stupid, and like something was wrong with me. \n",

      "To see my daughter now experiencing the same thing is heartbreaking. I do not believe (and I haven't believe for a very long time) that school is right for everyone. It just isn't. And yet that belief is constantly being challenged by the societal pressure (and state laws) which say that all children \\*have\\* to go to school - or else! And the children who go to school but don't do well? They are labeled as \"dumb,\" \"incompetent,\" \"learning disabled,\" etc. What is a parent to do when they KNOW that their child is very intelligent, but just not cut out for public education? Home schooling is an option, but that pretty much follows the same curriculum as public schools. Unschooling is another option, but I'm too nervous to try it and I have no idea how to even begin. I think that Waldorf-style schools are pretty fantastic, but they charge so much that I could never afford to give her that opportunity. I feel so lost, and I hate having to try and motivate/encourage her to \"do better\" when she really is doing the best she can.\n",

      "Just a little bit of a rant because it’s been a chaotic, stressful, long weekend. My 10 month old daughter has been fighting a sickness over the last week, coughing, congestion, runny nose. I was originally letting it run its course but then Friday she started coming down with fevers. First ones were relatively low but quick started building and that led me to start with fever suppression interventions. Late Friday night/early Saturday morning she ended up having a febrile seizure lasting 2 minutes. The fevers were just getting worse. We decided we needed to take her into the ER for help with diagnosis and addition fever management.. we got there they triaged her, pretty much ignored the mention that she had been sick for the days leading up and just immediately jumped to she probably has a UTI. They took urine from her and an hour later came back concluding she did have a UTI, gave me a prescription for the antibiotic cephalexin and sent me on my way, with the instruction to follow up with her pediatrician on Monday. Saturday and Sunday were long days for continuing to manage high fevers. Sunday night it seemed like the antibiotics were finally starting to kick in a little. \n",

      "Monday morning came and she was finally back to a normal body temp and we got to the pediatrician feeling like we maybe were on the other side of this now. Well, we were greeted by the pediatrician saying the hospitals cultures haven’t been fully processed and based off what the ER doctor left in the discharge paper the labs did NOT indicate UTI and he didn’t like the antibiotics they prescribed either. He then checked her ears and throat, which they didn’t do in the ER, and said it’s an ear and throat infection not a UTI. We proceeded to get a new urine sample which he ran and said it was clean. So now we’re waiting for the ER culture to be fully run to conclusively say that she never had a UTI in the first place and they misdiagnosed her in the ER? \n",

I know all babies go at their own pace, but I also understand that milestones have their timeframe for a reason.

I'm so anxious about her having reactions to foods that I've held her back from trying things. She's never had finger foods. She's only tried puffs and teething sticks in the last few months. She still hasn't had pureed fruits, or peanut butter, or any tree nuts. I've been trying to stick to the \"try a good for 3-5 days, then wait a few days to watch for delayed reaction\" method, but that's only one bed food a week! Our pediatrician asked if she's drinking from sippie cups or straws yet, and I didn't even know that was appropriate at this age. Of course she's never tried that.\n",

My husband and I are both getting kicked in the chest and face, and I'm getting my hair ripped out, then waking up on the edge of the bed exhausted in the morning.

We got medications for the rash, and then her skin broke out so she got two topical steroids for that. With all the nes meds and stomach issues and everyone being sick: I feel like we've hit suck a big bump in the road.

      "My 2 year old absolutely loves her. So much so that she is always wanting to hug on her and play with her. This morning, the dog was lying in her bed and my kid was making a silly noise near her face. The dog growled and then snapped her, leaving a mark just below her eye. So yes, I would say that it was a provoked attack, which I feel incredibly guilty over. I took my daughter to the ER since it was a facial injury and they applied dermabond. \n",

They said it'll be the same size of his pinky finger. I'm grieving hard but haven't processed the whole situation much because I can't stop worrying about when he sees his finger or what others are going to say to him for his future. I feel like I ruined his future. I believe I'm in denial right now since we just got home and I've looked up coping skills for him to process the event but now I'm thinking, how can I get myself to also accept this?

I'm not going to guilt trip him as he already feels like the worst and snuck off to cry at the ER (he's not an emotional man either). I also don't want to blame him and make my son feel like his dad can't protect him. But I also didn't let him off the hook just so he knows of how serious I am when I ask him to not proceed with things. He understands where my worries stem from now, sucks it had to come from this. All in all, I'm thankful it wasn't a brain injury or his whole finger.. But I'm still unsure how to cope or change my mindset about the life we failed to give him now.. I can't beat myself up, he needs me (I used to be a very victim mindset mother and I've gotten better). I also can't let him see im anxious about his new life with a deformed finger.

      "\n",
      "Hello all \n",
      "\n",
      "I am currently typing this while I’m in the hospital with my 18 month old son. So about a week ago I wrote a post on here asking for recommendation on how to help with a stuffy nose because my son was suffering from an ear infection, he was given amoxicillin to treat it however on the 5th day his lips started to swell and the following night he broke out in crazy hives I mean they’re all over his body as soon as I noticed them we rushed him to the ER. They gave him Benadryl and a steroid she observed him for an hour and sent him home however, she did inform me that the hives were due to an allergic reaction. the next morning when he woke up the hives were much much worse. And his lips were huge so we rushed him back to the ER on our way he started cough and grabbing at his tongue at this point I’m sooooooo scared because I feel like it swelling up. Once we get to the ER they inject an Epi pen and give him a steroid and a breathing treatment basically they sprung into action immediately. Yesterday they tested him for any and everything you can think of, any virus you can think of. They’ve done CT scans, x-rays YOU NAME IT everything is coming back negative so all signs are still pointing towards an allergic reaction to Amoxicillin Since that’s the only thing different. We are now day 2 in the hospital and his lips have gone down A LOT but not all the way and his hives are clearing up but they aren’t gone. His doctors informed me that because he took it for 6 days it could take some days for it to leave his system. Anyway has anyone else gone through this? I’m not allergic to amoxicillin and neither is my husband so this completely threw us for a loop. I do want to mention that last year my oldest son he’s 5 had tonsillitis and right after it cleared he broke out in hives as well and we think he was taking amoxicillin too. So it sounds like both of my boys can be allergic to amoxicillin. I’ve done research and I’m reading stories on here and other platforms about babies breaking out in rashes due to amoxicillin or going into full anaphylactic shock like my baby. \n",

If he bumped his head, pinched his finger, etc. he would take a deep breath in, go stick, and not breath out. His eyes would roll into the back of his head and he'd lose all color then go limp, and start breathing again. He was checked out in the hospital and by his pediatrician. He had about 8-10 of these episodes before he was 18 months old. Then they stopped. He did have what we and the ER doctors believe is another one this last summer when he got hurt and collapsed similarly. He had all sorts of scans done then and he was okay. I don't know if these are linked to his fevers. \n",
      "He started preschool when he was 3 about to be 4 and the first year in preschool he was sick constantly. Like every other week while his immune system adjusted to other children. I took him into the doctor multiple times because of not only how often he would spike fevers but how high they would get. At times getting up to 104. On top of this, I began realizing that he would hallucinate while having a fever. He will think people are after him, he will try to run all over the house to find safety. He will insist his pokemon need to go to the poke center or that there are anacondas and crocidiles all over the room trying to kill us. Sometimes he tells me that he's dead or going to die. At one point he acted like he astral projected to a park down town screaming that he was lost and couldn't find our house. I described the path home from that park and then he snapped out of it. He did this again tonight. He has like hand spasms. At times he has hit himself and he will try to get up and take off running. \n",

She was too little to remember the process, seeing her grandmother so sick, and all the stress that came with it (which I have gratitude for.) 11 months after paternal grandmother passing, my mom (LO maternal grandmother) was diagnosed with Glioblastoma. We are very close with my parents, so LO is definitely already feeling the separation as my mom spends more time in hospitals, and overall health is declining. Now that she’s 3… awareness is here. I have no idea how to navigate my mom getting sicker and ultimately passing. I don’t know how to explain that. I don’t know how to be a caretaker of my mom, have a full time job, and be the mom of a 3 year old. I have so much grief that we are going through this again, and my LO will have to grow up without any grandmothers. \n",

      " \n",
      "5 words which would precede the worst night of our lives as parents. I’d just come out of our steamed-up bathroom trying to give our tiny young son some relief, but he was still struggling to breathe.\n",
      " \n",
      "Our son. Archie. A beautiful little boy. A fighter. Born 6 weeks premature, weighing 1.43kg (3.15lbs) had faced restricted growth in the womb, and then 5 weeks in NICU before coming home. He took everything his difficult start to life threw at him and never complained. His big sister Lily, 3, was also a beautiful wee baby born 2.9kg (6.39lbs), and from the moment she came into this world she was sassy, demanding, full of life. Archie was the opposite to her – calm, chill, went along with the tide. We were overjoyed to have opposite but equally amazing young children in our lives. After the NICU stay he was back home with his people, and our family was complete again. My amazing wife had sacrificed so much for this wee boy, experiencing a rough high-risk pregnancy well before he was born, but he was ours and he was home.\n",
      " \n",
      "A few weeks later he got sick. Probably RSV, but he was unwell. Blocked up, struggling to breathe – in a blind panic my wife and mother-in-law rushed him to the Emergency Department where he was triaged and promptly admitted into the children’s ward. He didn’t need breathing support, though it was touch and go, and within a few nights he was back home with us. Still sick but getting better. That was, at the time, a terrifying experience for us but would pale in comparison to just a week later.\n",
      " \n",
      "“I think he’s getting worse” I text my wife who was picking Lily up from daycare. Our son had been sick again for a few days, and we had diligently supported him in every way we could at home, but there came a moment where the decline become certain. Part of me was still in denial, but I knew something wasn’t right. He was working to breathe – like really, truly working. “What the fuck do we do??” my mind raced. My wife arrived home, and we got ready to take him to ED. At this point, while he was struggling, we weren’t overly worried – “They’ll send him home for monitoring” we both thought. My amazing Mother-in-law headed in straight away to support my wife at ED, while I looked after the Lily at home and got her ready for bed.\n",
      "An hour or so later, my wife called. “He needs to go into the city – they are having trouble reading his oxygen saturation, and think he might need an ambulance” and a few minutes later “His sats have stabilised a bit so we can drive him in”. At this point we agreed my MIL would come home to keep watch over our daughter, and I’d head in to meet my wife and we’d commute into the city together with Archie.\n",
      " \n",
      "The drive to meet my wife was eerie. It had been leaden skies all day, but very calm. Now, with the sun going down and a light rain beginning to fall, the light turned green. As I was passing under the interchange to get onto the express way, one of the street lights blew above me.\n",
      " \n",
      "A memory – seared into my being. I arrived at the local hospital just as the light failed. I saw my wife, small, with the large baby backpack on, pushing the pram in the worsening rain to meet me at the car. I parked the truck and dashed through the rain to them – my sons wails piercing the night and the rain. “Why’s he wailing like that???” I thought to myself – he’d never cried like that, ever. His tiny, plaintive wails in the rain, my wife trying to get him loaded into the car, my heart broke. I’ll never forget this memory.\n",
      "We convoyed into the city, my wife in the car with Archie, me in my truck, talking on the car phones – a deep pit of fear, uncertainty, confusion forming in our guts. I could hear his wailing over the car phones and was glad that I could at least share the load with my wife. The thought of her having to experience that on her own almost broke my heart again.\n",
      "We arrived at the hospital and parked underground but had to dash to the ED through the rain. Thankfully the hospital orderlies helped us by allowing us to head some of the way through the main hospital.\n",
      " \n",
      "ED. Triage. It was busy, busier than I’d ever seen it but such is the state of healthcare across the globe. Triage seemed to take an age. He was struggling and now pale. He’d cough, and then wouldn’t breathe (apnea) for 10-15 seconds, unless we helped him. “Have a seat” they told us. “Fuck me” I thought! “Can’t you see how sick he is????”. We turned around to see a sea of misery, and no seats, but people stood for us without question. The compassion in that moment from everyone who had watched us enter, and be triaged, was deeply touching.\n",
      "5 mins later, a pead nurse came and fetched us. The paediatric area of ED was full so we were waiting in the corridor for a space to become free, She hooked Archie up to two oxygen monitors. He started to become unsettled on me (I was holding him at this point to try to keep him warm) so she popped him tummy first onto my wife’s chest. The nurse was getting agitated. Another nurse was shadowing this nurse and watching her intently. “Call the Pead Doctors” she said – setting into motion the culmination of our agony.\n",
      " \n",
      "What felt like seconds later the nurse had kicked another family out of a cubicle, doctors appeared he was whisked into a resus cot. At this point, Archie had almost given up. He’d tried so hard, for so long to keep going but by now his tiny, tiny body had nothing left in the tank. We were moved aside as four doctors, and four nurses started working on him. Our world collapsed, watching our tiny boy, his body having tried so hard, so hard for hours had almost given up. We were asked for his “history” to distract us, but the distraction was welcome. After a few minutes, they moved us through ED into a larger room for the team to have more space to work on him. Took a viral swab. They managed to get him stabilised and on high flow oxy after 45 minutes or so, and we were able to have a cuddle. It was clear he needed to be admitted.\n",
      " \n",
      "After another hour or so, about midnight, we were moved to the children’s ward. After this I left at midnight to give my MIL a break and to be there for our daughter when she woke up. Back in the children’s ward, Archie was put on CPAP but started to become very agitated, which was worrying the doctors. They decided to take him off and ordered a chest x-ray. After some consideration, they moved him over to ICU about 5am the next morning.\n",
      " \n",
      "Once he was in ICU, my wife had just managed to fall asleep when she was suddenly awoken by emergency alarm ringing, 3 nurses standing around Archie bagging him, and a fourth nurse coming over to comfort her. This is the image that has been seared into my wife’s memory. Luckily, they were able to stabilise him quickly and he was put back onto CPAP. We later learned this was a mucous plugging event – his airways were blocked up and he was too exhausted to clear them himself, so he needed help to do it for him.\n",
      "Around this time the swab results came back in – Rhinovirus. “You mean the common cold did this??” we asked with some disbelief. Indeed it was so – given how small and vulnerable he is, even just the common cold can cause significant issues for babies with such small airways.\n",
      " \n",
      "All up we spent 2 nights in intensive care, and three in the ward. The medical staff are true hero’s – we cannot speak highly enough of them and will be grateful to them for all time.\n",
      "We’re now at home again and a family again, trying our best to protect our son for getting another virus. We still have a ways to go with him as he’s still on a feeding tube and may have hearing issues so working through what feels like countless medical appointments, but the most important thing, is that we are all together again. I’ve also learned - we are his parents, and our children are ours, but only nature has the ultimate claim to them. \n",

I didn’t understand the full extent of his illness before we got married, or before we had kids. It got MUCH worse in his late 20s. SI has been dang near constant. Last Summer he received the diagnosis of OCD after being admitted inpatient to the hospital because he planned to commit suicide. He stayed unwell and latched hard onto some really bad coping mechanisms-an eating disorder intensified to the point his BMI was 12, and he’s currently in intensive outpatient for 12 hours a week. He keeps a happy face on for everyone else and is an amazing husband and dad. But he is still suffering inside.\n",

      "I myself had mental health struggles as a child and it was suggested to my parents that they put me on a low dose Prozac syrup as young as 5.

      "Now my sweet beautiful child (5.5) has been cursed with genetics from both sides. She is the single most anxious child I have ever met. She has panic attacks regularly. She anticipates things for days in advance and just cries and cries and cries. She sees the guidance counselor at school nearly daily because she becomes so distraught that it becomes a barrier to the other children learning. She’s practiced hot chocolate breathing and cupcake breathing and lemon squeezing to calm herself down. She has headphones for when she gets overstimulated at school. There’s a county wide mental health worker who sees her every other week at school and still no progress. She has INTENSE separation anxiety, and even though she enjoys so many things about school, she weeps and weeps before during and after school about wanting to be with me. Even when I’m actively cuddling her she is crying about in the future when she will not be with me. I have an intake with an additional Psychologist outside the school scheduled as well and I just feel so helpless. She is **SO** far beyond run of the mill anxiety and I can’t escape the fear she’s going to suffer her entire life like her dad does. She is the absolute most wonderful child and my heart cannot take seeing her in the kind of pain she’s in. I specialized in clinical social work and specialized in working with children, and even with all that professional expertise in this area I am helpless to help her. \n",

His maladaptive coping mechanisms were all tied to ED and were invisible to us, which is why things got as bad as they did. He would compulsively exercise after we were asleep, skip meals for extended periods of time, walk to the grocery store to weigh himself, throw away food so he wouldn’t be tempted to eat it, among other things. But through all of that he has acted remarkably normal-he cooks and cleans and plays with the kids. To them he is just their dad. I would largely say our home life feels stable. \n",

Im aware it's early and alot of parents tend to say \"oh start potty training them whenever their comfortable and ready\" but alot of schools don't accept that your child isn't potty trained (which as a substitute i can understand- no teacher should change the nappy of a 10 year old) and personally i REFUSE to send my child in a special school or a special ed class. As an autistic person myself who's been in a Special Ed class for 6 years it was ABSOLUTE hell, the teachers make you feel like outcast and when you have potential they tend to lower down your expectations, and they also tend to treat their students as if they we're toddlers so personally im not comfortable sending my son to class especially with the fact that Carter is bright, he definitely has potential just have to put the effort in and im aware if i send him to an adaptation class he won't be able to fulfil that potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "So anyway- im trying to get Carter potty trained before he goes to school. With the school that we plan to send him too they mentioned that kids that are in Pre-K and Kindergarten don't tend to be fully potty trained and that's it's more acceptable. (Especially with the fact they have their own bathrooms in class) so my goal is to get my son potty trained so does anyone have any helpful tips:)?\n",

      "Post 488: Supporting kids experiencing trans/homophobic bullying\n",
      "\n",
      "I thought this level of “what-about-ism” was reserved for bots and trolls but I assure you this is real: my straight, cis-gendered middle schooler is on her 3rd year of regular bullying for being “trans” and “lesbian,” despite being neither. These are weird times — unless you have kids in school *right now* in grades 4-10 I’m not sure you can relate because this definitely related to current social trends/movements. \n",
      "\n",
      "She is the second tallest girl in her grade, has broad shoulders, and could do modeling if we cared at all about things like modeling. She’s very beautiful inside and out but I admit it’s a bit of an androgynous beauty. She has always kind of loved her ability to fit in with the boys, grew up with 3 older brothers, would wear their T-shirts and watch their shows and go to Disneyland one day as Thor (the boy costume, not Lady Thor) and the next day as Belle, Rapunzel or Cinderella because she’s also a princess. \n",
      "\n",
      "In elementary school she asked for and received mostly joggers and Minecraft t-shirts, with the occasional anime or Pokemon shirt and a lot of stretchy athletic skirts to femme up her look. She wears boxers. She had an undercut for a long time, she grew it out and wears her hair long. The “why do you dress like a boy” teasing began in 3rd grade with insistence that she “sit with the girls because YOU ARE A GIRL,” and she insisted she could sit with/be friends with anyone and this led to very real drama. \n",
      "\n",
      "From there it progressed to bullying: insistence that she use “they” pronouns since she insists on behaving in a nonbinary way, accusations that she is trans, accusations she was born a boy and is M2F, girls not letting her join “girl only” groups during activities and on a couple of occasions refusing to let her use the girl’s restroom. Teachers and Administrators have tried to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point she wanted to declare herself trans so it would stop. I am 100% in favor of my children being their authentic selves, but I am not okay with living a lie to gain social acceptance so we directed her instead to join up with the alphabet soup kids when she starts middle school; kids who wouldn’t care if she’s trans or not. She did this, and is also a member of the LGTBQ+ club. \n",
      "\n",
      "So now my straight child is friends with all the gay kids at middle school, which has mostly shielded her from anyone who would question her identity or sexuality and also given her a group of people who will enforce her pronouns (which are she/her). She refuses to shave her legs or her armpits, there has been some bullying about that in PE on swim days but her trans boy bestie defended her so she didn’t come home too traumatized (and still won’t shave). \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, we mostly thought it was past us but a girl she is not super close with but hangs out with during one class that has a lot of group activities belongs to a homophobic clique. I have no other words for it—this girl’s two friends have repeatedly asked my daughter if she has a crush on one of them. As my child does not like girls, she answered “no…?” She tolerated them constantly making her go get supplies during group activities, they’re kinda mean but ONE OF THEM was always nice so my daughter thought she was a friend and tried to ignore the “crush” comments. This came to a head last week when she brought LITERAL CUPCAKES to school, was offering the leftovers to friends, and made a joke like “they have special cream on top…[dramatic pause]…BUTTERCREAM. What? What did you think I was going to say? They’re BUTTERCREAM!” Classic middle school humor. \n",
      "\n",
      "But this dumb joke was taken by this homophobic clique as if she were offering to this girl to ~eat her muffin~, which is a euphemism I had to explain to my 12 yo child (face palm). The “friend” saw a school counselor, recalled another incident during Outdoor Ed when my child “touched her leg,” and basically publicly accused my child of being a lesbian making unwanted advances. Which didn’t happen—she was literally offering a literal cupcake and made a crude frosting joke, and she doesn’t like girls. She has a boy in her life (they play Minecraft nearly every day) and this boy is the only person she has a mild crush on; they are just friends and don’t want/aren’t ready to date. \n",
      "\n",
      "OMG this is so long, but there is a part I need advice on; the school counselor threatened “serious consequences” if my daughter spoke to this girl again or told anyone else about it. I want my daughter to get peer support from her LGBTQ Club because I perceive this as an act of homophobia: if she hadn’t been perceived by others as a gay girl there is no way for her behavior to be interpreted as offensive, and when it’s your group identity that makes something otherwise normal offensive to another person there is bigotry at play. I think the other girl is mostly innocent in this, and that her friends built up a narrative that my child was hitting on this girl all school year and the “cupcake joke” crossed the line; she was really adamant to the counselor that she didn’t want to hurt my child’s feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the only way to resolve this without my child being buried by shame/guilt is for other members of her LGBTQ+ Club to provide social support, agree she was wronged and her friend should have just spoken to her directly, and maybe even confront these girls about their blatant homophobia so they’ll think twice about (over)reacting to someone just trying to be a friend. This is a violation of the agreement she made with the school counselor, but we have a call scheduled for Monday AM and I want to undo this verbal gag order. There are only a few weeks of school left: I’d rather these other girls be wondering if they made a grave mistake all summer than my own child be ashamed/anxious that she can’t make friends anymore because everyone will continue to ASSume she is gay and making advances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Am I in the wrong on this, and is it worth insisting with the school counselor that she has the right to seek peer support by discussing this awkward incident with friends?\n",

      "Post 489: I (22F) am having trouble handling my brother (17M) who I chose to take care of\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me just start this post off with some backstory. (Skip this part if you don’t want to read a ton of context I’ll note the section with “***”)\n",
      "*****I (22F)am the second eldest of 4 half siblings that I grew up with. We all have different dads except for my two younger brothers who are full siblings(my mom has 3 bds). Growing up our mom was very abusive to all of us , physically,emotionally, and mentally and my brothers’ dad was being abused himself and did nothing to help us. Eventually we lost contact with him after my mom divorced him when I was 16. He is also fairly unstable himself so none of my siblings have intentions to reconnect at this time. Meanwhile, me and my eldest sister have had to fill in for the roles of parents to the best of our abilities since we were young to our younger brothers. But, since we were kids ourselves not everything was perfect and I wasn’t always the kindest when dealing with my brothers before I turned 16. This, along with the fact that we were all heavily abused, has made me feel like I have to overcompensate with my current behavior towards my brothers since I wish I had been kinder to them. \n",
      "Anyways, fast forward to more recently,I left my mom’s toxic house hold at 18 and have been living on my own in a 1 bdrm apartment since then. It was very hard for me to leave my little brothers behind but I knew I couldn’t stay there. Since then me and my brother who is about 5 years younger than me that we’ll call “Jay” (17M)have been pretty close emotionally. Whenever Jay was dealing with a mental health crisis primarily due to my mom and her abusive behavior, or just anything in general he would confide in me. I promised both my brothers that I would get them out of that house and it wouldn’t have to be as hard for them as it would be for me(saving up for an apartment, struggling financially and not being able to focus on long term goals etc etc). Well, a few months before Jay’s 17th birthday last year I had the opportunity to take him in. My siblings and I were homeschooled but since my mom never put in work to teach us I had to drop out and wasn’t able to get a GED until 20 bc of life circumstances. I am now working full time as well as in school and have shown that I can support myself. My mom was having a lot of trouble in particular homeschooling Jay because she doesn’t have patience and Jay isn’t as independent as my sister and I. Jay was also increasingly acting out and my mom could no longer threaten him with physical abuse because he’s been sticking up for himself more. ******\n",
      "Eventually, my mom agreed to let Jay (17M) live with me(22F) for a few months so that he can do a free ged program available in my town since I suggested it. I was honestly very surprised. She lives out of state and is very controlling so that was a big deal. Overtime, my mom let go of the ideal of ever getting Jay back because he is turning 18 this year and has expressed wanting to live with me. Although I am very happy to help my little brother out and take him out of my mom’s extremely abusive household as well as set him up for things I found challenging on my own, I feel that things are a little harder than I expected. My sister and I were both very independent even before we left our mom’s house and would basically manage all household duties as well as teach ourselves whatever schooling we could since our homeschool mom neglected everything. Jay doesn’t seem to have that. I know he is capable of doing household tasks like light chores and cooking but about 3 months into him moving in with me, he stopped doing things without constant asking/nagging. If I let him he will just sit on his video games all day and do nothing. He does have a part time job but beyond that and the GED program he’s in he doesn’t do much. It’s very hard to get him to do his homework for the GED program as well. He has passed all his tests to get it except for math and I have been putting in extra work to try to help him so he won’t fail the math portion again but he doesn’t follow any of the study plans I make for him. It’s very frustrating sometimes and I feel like I’ve tried everything. Sit down talks to try to explain the issues of ask if there is something else going on or if he needs something extra from me have not worked, we’ve had several and he’ll agree to act right but will be back to his usual behavior the next day. I will admit that there’s been 2-3 times where I’ve lost my cool on him but I am very frustrated. I just think he is taking advantage of the situation because he knows I care about him too much to send him back to our abusive mom and he knows I feel bad yelling at him or being overly stern. He doesn’t help around the house unless I get up and do it which is a problem because when I am busy(since I have college and the full time job) or sick  he doesn’t clean up even though he’s the main mess maker or make himself food. He also will not do his homework on his own which is a big problem since he has only one more try on his ged math before they delay him and he won’t have a shot at applying for higher ed schools/college this year. I also just find this behavior pretty ungrateful and disrespectful. I know my home isn’t perfect but I have accommodated him to follow through on my promise of getting him out of living with our mom and have plans to move in a bigger house since he currently has to sleep on a bed I set up in my living room. I also only charge him $100 a month in rent to help with cost of food and living expenses since we get no help from our parents. He is a good kid and does pitch in more sometimes if we’re in a rough spot but I always pay him back and he knows he can count on that(in that aspect I think he is grateful). But other than that I have made sure that he has thousands of dollars in savings so he’ll get a better head start in life than I did. He doesn’t really get into any trouble and is kind outside of the whole chore/responsibility situation but I’m just worried because he’s almost 18 and in no way ready for the real world. Without me I don’t think he would eat more than one meal a day, get any sort of education, or clean at all. He has lashed out a lot if I press the issue too much as well which makes it pretty exhausting because he doesn’t see that I am coming from a good place of concern even though I try to be nice about it most days. I am also worried for the future because I plan to move in with my boyfriend and his 8 year old child in a few months and we have agreed to let Jay live with us unless he wants to do something else or move out to a college campus. My boyfriend thinks I should put my foot down and set down harsh ultimatums to get his act together but that’s never gone well and it breaks my heart to threaten Jay. Sorry that this post is so long but to anyone who read it, thank you and I would truly appreciate any advice\n",
