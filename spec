# Todo plan

Reddit API
Selected subreddits (start with one) - r/Parenting,
List keywords to identify possible injury related posts - child injury, falls, poison, drowning, accidents,
Search using Subreddit.search method (Cannot search by date time). - limitation or can search for all within the subreddit and filter later programmatically
Look into rate limiting and logging if needed
Download only those discussions (raw data)
Further search for injury events - Reddit search is too broad, use LLM to search and classify
Clean PII (Manually) - clean data
Further analysis into injury scenarios - how?
